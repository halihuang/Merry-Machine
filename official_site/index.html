    <p>Ofcourse, we don't want to distract from the current civil rights and humanitarian events going on in the world today. However, it is important that we not only look at the negative news which the media illustrates, but to look at the strides that are being made in these areas and in other areas.</p>

      MerryMachine is a news-filtering site that divides news articles from various sources into several different catagories: positive, negative, political, and neutral. Ofcourse, we don't have a human sift through all the articles; we have a machine do it! This allows for you to read the most up-to-date content from some of the top sources in the U.S. (and hopefully from other nations in upcoming updates).
