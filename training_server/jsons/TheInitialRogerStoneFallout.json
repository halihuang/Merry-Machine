It\u2019s Monday, and this is your politics tip sheet. ImageWhere things standSome high-profile Republicans \u2014 as well as just about every Democrat with a microphone \u2014 are crying foul after President Trump announced on Friday that he was commuting the sentence of Roger Stone, his old friend and former adviser. Stone, who was convicted of seven felonies \u2014 including perjury and obstruction of justice \u2014 had been sentenced to 40 months in prison.Trump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence just days before he was to report to prison, in spite of warnings from White House advisers that doing so \u201cwould be politically self-destructive if not ethically inappropriate,\u201d as Peter Baker writes in an analysis.Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, has shied away from publicly criticizing Trump, but on Saturday he published an op-ed article in The Washington Post defending the work of his office, and the eight guilty pleas or convictions at trial \u2014 including Stone\u2019s \u2014 that it secured.\u201cThe Russia investigation was of paramount importance,\u201d Mueller writes. \u201cStone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.\u201d Later, Mueller insists: \u201cThe women and men who conducted these investigations and prosecutions acted with the highest integrity. Claims to the contrary are false.\u201dCharacteristically, Mueller does not question the president directly in the op-ed. Instead, he seems to mostly be addressing Trump\u2019s supporters and anyone else who disputes the legitimacy of the Russia investigation.This invites one question \u2014 Why try to do this in the pages of The Washington Post, hardly a trusted publication among Trump fans? \u2014 while declining to address another: As special counsel, a lengthy feature in the current issue of The New Yorker asks, why didn\u2019t Mueller push harder to equip Congress with the tools to remove Trump from office?Senator Lindsey Graham, a fierce defender of Trump, said yesterday that he would call Mueller to testify before the Judiciary Committee, signaling he would keep trying to discredit the Russia investigation.At least two Republican senators, Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, criticized Trump\u2019s decision to free Stone. \u201cUnprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,\u201d Romney wrote on Twitter on Saturday.Toomey, who is typically an ally of the president, was more measured. \u201cWhile I understand the frustration with the badly flawed Russia-collusion investigation, in my view, commuting Roger Stone\u2019s sentence is a mistake,\u201d Toomey said in a statement.Trump shot back in an angry tweet late Saturday, calling both senators \u201cRINO\u2019s,\u201d or Republicans In Name Only.The number of new daily coronavirus cases in the United States topped 60,000 for the first time on Friday. Recorded cases are now on the rise in 37 states, prompting many state governments to re-evaluate plans to reopen their economies.Florida announced 15,000 new cases of the virus yesterday, the highest single-day total of known infections for any state thus far. The number of cases among members of the U.S. military has more than doubled in the past month. The country is now averaging roughly 700 deaths from the virus each day, from less than 500 earlier this month \u2014 but still far lower than the mid-April average of more than 2,200.Trump, yielding to months of pressure from advisers and the advice of his own public health team, wore a face mask in public for the first time during a visit on Saturday to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a hospital, especially,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing to wear a mask.\u201dIn an interview yesterday with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, said the widespread use of masks would be essential to stemming the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cIn order for us to reverse this problem, we need about 90 percent of people in those really hot areas to wear masks when they\u2019re in public,\u201d Giroir said. He declined to say whether he thought the federal government should make mask-wearing mandatory nationwide.A number of major corporations announced heavy layoffs last week, in the early rumblings of what economists say may be the start of a new phase in the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout.After unemployment skyrocketed at the start of the outbreak, things briefly seemed as though they might stabilize. But now, with economic activity looking uncertain for the duration of the year and consumer confidence remaining low, companies are making longer-term adjustments and cutting more workers loose.Congress is stuck in a holding pattern on further virus relief legislation, as Republicans in the Senate have refused to take up the $3 trillion relief bill that House Democrats passed in May.But another round of stimulus legislation appears inevitable, and on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d yesterday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to draw a red line: She said it was essential that Congress extend the $600-a-week expansion to unemployment benefits that is set to expire at the end of this month. \u201cWe must extend the unemployment insurance,\u201d Pelosi told Dana Bash. \u201cPeople are desperately in need.\u201dIn an interview with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, echoed Trump\u2019s declaration from last week that schools must reopen in the fall, even as virus infections surge. She repeated the president\u2019s threat that districts could lose federal funding if they refused to comply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous,\u201d she said.But in a confidential government report circulated around the White House this month and obtained by The New York Times last week, the Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force argues the opposite. The 69-page document states that fully reopening schools and universities constitutes the \u201chighest risk\u201d for continuing to spread the virus in the fall.While Republicans continue to search for a winning message on the virus, Democrats up and down the ballot have sought to exploit their opponents\u2019 mixed messages. One example: Majority Forward, a political action committee, has begun running an ad targeting Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican who will face off against a strong Democratic challenger in November, for his votes against funding supplies for health care workers.Photo of the dayImageCredit...Erin Scott for The New York TimesPresident Trump wearing a mask on Saturday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.\",\"author\":\"By Giovanni Russonello\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/roger-stone-trump.html\",\"type\":\"negative\"}"
