My Curls Aren\u2019t Wanted.I know if I want to land more roles, I need to look white.[MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] You\u2019re right, Grandma. I\u2019m a pretty great actor. The best in the world is a big statement, but sure. Gracias, Abuelita. Watch out, Denzel. Abuelita didn\u2019t know the rules. Mission No. 1 in L.A., go unnoticed, sort of. Blend in, not too edgy, and too soft. Be you, if you are something we all see you as \u2014 make sense? It\u2019s tough. Be the best and stand out while blending in, got it? It takes time, practice, and thick skin, but not too thick or too dark, OK? Signed, Hollywood. Man, you\u2019ve come a long way, Chris, Since that acting school big thick-ass Dominican \u2018fro you used to rock. Calm your curls, Rivas, calm your curls, Rivas, calm your curls. There\u2019s a conversation you don\u2019t want to have anymore. You\u2019ve been sitting in this chair for six years calming these curls so you can look like something classic and unidentifiable. Mr. Rivas, have a seat and listen up. Now, your job, as a man of color, isn\u2019t to stand out, but to fit in, to fit the roles they want you to play. And you have fit in. You have done a real good job of fitting in. Congrats, Rivas, on a life of blending in in response to the stories and heroes on TV played by the white boys who don\u2019t look like you. Their hair don\u2019t curl the same way. But you too want to tell these stories. And so you chop. You get a cut that says, yeah, I can fit into your boxes. For who do I want to look this way? Do I really want to kick it on fake stoops in fake urban cities on fake landscapes with a bunch of brown people with crew cuts? Will I get everything I ever wanted, only to realize it is a nightmare to be seen by eyes that don\u2019t actually see you? In jungles, you find your pack. In prison, you find the ones who will protect you. In Hollywood, if you look as ethnically ambiguous as you, and you want to play the game, then you\u2019ve got to know the rules, their rules, and you\u2019ve got to play the part. And that means code switching, and staying out of the sun, and keeping your thick curls at bay, because it\u2019s all a part of survival. That\u2019s it, huh? Survival? That\u2019s grim. That\u2019s bleak, Rivas. Montages of false people, people of color, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not our friends, it\u2019s not our family, it\u2019s not the people we love, so who cares? I want to care. You want to care. You want to thrive, I know. Thrive, don\u2019t just survive, and leave a good tip. [MUSIC PLAYING]I know if I want to land more roles, I need to look white.Actors of color trying to make it in Hollywood face a paradox: To succeed, you need to stand out from the crowd while assimilating as much as possible. Be yourself while fitting in. And if you aspire to be like one of those leading men you grew up watching on TV, well, you better look the part. Step 1: Calm those curls. In the video above, Dominican-American actor Christopher Rivas reflects from the barber\u2019s chair on the hundreds of crew cuts he\u2019s gotten over the course of his career in hopes of appeasing casting directors who have a certain unwavering vision of how a star actor looks.While there\u2019s been a lot of talk about diversity in Hollywood, progress has been modest. A 2019 report looked at 100 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2018 and found that only 3 percent of the lead or colead roles went to Latinos (and a similar study found only 27 percent of the top 100 movies in 2018 had leads or coleads of color). Latinos have accounted for half the U.S. population growth over the past decade and make up 18 percent of the population. When will we get to see our nation\u2019s diversity reflected on our screens?Christopher Rivas (@christopher__rivas) is an actor.\",\"author\":\"By Christopher Rivas\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/opinion/hollywood-latinos-diversity.html\",\"type\":\"neutral\"}"
