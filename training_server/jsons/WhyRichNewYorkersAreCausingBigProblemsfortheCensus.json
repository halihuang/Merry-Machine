"{\"title\":\"Why Rich New Yorkers Are Causing Big Problems for the Census\",\"summary\":\"If residents who fled the virus for second homes aren\u2019t counted, the city could lose out on crucial federal money \u2014 and congressional seats.\",\"text\":\"When city officials took on the herculean task of getting every New York City household to fill out the census, an eat-your-vegetables exercise that provides millions in federal aid to low-income residents, they didn\u2019t expect the Upper East Side to pose much of a problem.But the coronavirus has upended census-takers\u2019 best-laid plans. And that may have serious financial implications for the city.Only 46 percent of Upper East Side households have filled out their census forms, according to a June 25 report circulated by the Department of City Planning\u2019s chief demographer, Joseph J. Salvo \u2014 well below the neighborhood\u2019s final response rate in 2010, and short of the current citywide rate of almost 53 percent.The reason?\u201cThey\u2019re not here,\u201d said Liz Krueger, a Democratic state senator, referring to her constituents in Midtown and the Upper East Side. \u201cNo one\u2019s here.\u201dMany New Yorkers who had the wherewithal to leave the city did so, just as the census was getting under way this spring. Thinned-out neighborhoods stopped producing as much garbage. Mail-forwarding requests shot through the roof.And for census officials, wealthier neighborhoods in Manhattan are now unexpectedly proving some of the hardest to reach.Only about 38 percent of households in Midtown Manhattan have filled out their census forms \u2014 the second-worst response rate in all of New York City, after North Corona, Queens, which is at about 37 percent. The rate is only slightly better in the area encompassing SoHo, Tribeca, Civic Center and Little Italy, which is home to wealthy residents as well as many college students; those tracts have response rates of about 46 percent.\",\"author\":\"By Dana Rubinstein\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/census-nyc-midtown-coronavirus.html\",\"type\":\"negative\"}"
