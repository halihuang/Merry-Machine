"{\"title\":\"Speaking on Charity Scandal, Trudeau Adopts a Now-Familiar Tone of Contrition\",\"summary\":\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada apologized for failing to recuse himself in the awarding of a government contract to a charity with deep connections to his family.\",\"text\":\"After digging in his heels for days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada changed tack on Monday and apologized for taking part in a decision to award a no-bid government contract to a charity deeply connected to his family.The apology came four days after it was revealed that the prime minister\u2019s mother and brother had received more than $200,000 over four years to give speeches at events for the development organization, called the WE Charity, which had been awarded a government contract to oversee the disbursement of hundreds of millions of dollars of student grants.\u201cI made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions given our family\u2019s history, and I\u2019m sincerely sorry about not having done that,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau from outside his Ottawa home, during one of the briefings he has given regularly since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.At Monday\u2019s news conference, the virus took a back seat to a sustained grilling from reporters about the charity scandal.The controversy began brewing earlier this month, when opposition politicians demanded an investigation into the government\u2019s approval of the contract to the charity to distribute about $660 million in grants to student volunteers affected by the weakened economy.The prime minister, who said Monday that the contract was selected by the country\u2019s civil service, has spoken at many of WE Charity\u2019s events, and his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, hosts a podcast connected to the charity.Then, last Thursday, it was revealed the charity had paid Mr. Trudeau\u2019s mother and brother a total of $207,000, about 282,000 Canadian dollars, for speaking engagements.The country\u2019s ethics commissioner has already launched an investigation into the affair, marking the third time the prime minister has been investigated for breaking conflict-of-interest rules since coming to power in 2015 on a promise of openness and transparency.Both previous times, he was found in breach of the rules, which badly damaged his brand. His Liberal Party only narrowly won re-election last year.\u201cThe question is, \u2018Does the scandal go away, or does it continue?\u2019\u201d said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. \u201cA lot of that is out of his control. It\u2019s down to what the opposition parties do.\u201dShe noted that the prime minister\u2019s approval rating, which has soared over the past four months because of his perceived deft handling of the coronavirus, had dropped to 50 percent according to data her firm released Monday.So far, the scandal has not shown signs of abating, as revelations have arisen about other people in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s inner circle with personal connections to the charity.Finance Minister Bill Morneau, whose daughter works in the charity\u2019s travel department, also apologized on Monday. \u201cI did not recuse myself from the discussions on this topic and, given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict,\u201d he said in a Twitter post.Craig and Marc Kielburger, who founded the WE Charity together, took out a full-page ad in The Globe and Mail, a national newspaper, on Monday stating they \u201chad made mistake that we sincerely regret\u201d and that the last two weeks had led them to \u201cmore closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.\u201dThe charity said it would waive all the administrative costs incurred in setting up the program and would return government funds already received. The charity had been slated to receive a total of $14 million for overseeing the program.Mr. Trudeau has developed a reputation in Canada for delivering contrite apologies, both for historical government transgressions and for his own personal mistakes, including going to parties in blackface and brownface as a student and young teacher.At Monday\u2019s news conference, Mr. Trudeau said he was most sorry students would not get access as quickly to the aid program, established to award some students up to 5,000 Canadian dollars in grants for doing volunteer work. The government took over the program after the scandal surfaced.With no election on the horizon, it\u2019s unlikely the scandal will deeply damage Mr. Trudeau, said Lori Turnbull, director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax.\u201cIt\u2019s not a terribly damning apology. It\u2019s quite clever. He\u2019s not saying the decision was wrong, he\u2019s saying he shouldn\u2019t have been at the table for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is very, very low risk for him.\u201d\",\"author\":\"By Catherine Porter\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/canada/trudeau-we-charity-apology.html\",\"date\":\"July 13, 2020, 9:36 p.m. ET\",\"source\":\"NY Times\",\"type\":\"negative\"}"
