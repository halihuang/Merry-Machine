"{\"title\":\"Daughter\u2019s Obituary Blames Politicians for Arizona Man\u2019s Virus Death\",\"summary\":\"Kristin Urquiza, writing about her father\u2019s death, pointed the finger at how state and federal leaders have handled the coronavirus pandemic.\",\"text\":\"When Kristin Urquiza\u2019s father died last month in Arizona, she wrote an obituary that offered not one but two causes of death: the coronavirus, and ineptitude on the part of government officials.Mark Anthony Urquiza, \u201clike so many others, should not have died,\u201d Ms. Urquiza wrote in an impassioned obituary published in The Arizona Republic.\u201cHis death,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis due to the carelessness of the politicians who continue to jeopardize the health of brown bodies through a clear lack of leadership, refusal to acknowledge the severity of this crisis, and inability and unwillingness to give clear and decisive direction on how to minimize risk.\u201dIn many respects, the article Ms. Urquiza wrote about her father, who died June 30 at age 65, was an ordinary obituary. It noted that he was a high school 400-meter dash state champion and a cross-country runner. It listed survivors. And it offered a sense of his personality: \u201cMark was known for his infectious energy, strong will, and yes, stubbornness.\u201dBut in a state that was slower than some to issue a stay-at-home order, and quicker to reopen, Ms. Urquiza did not contain herself to the strictly personal, though the obituary did not name either Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona or President Trump.\",\"author\":\"By Aimee Ortiz\",\"link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/arizona-coronavirus-mark-anthony-urquiza.html\",\"type\":\"negative\"}"
