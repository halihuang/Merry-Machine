"{\"title\":\"How American Gun Laws Are Fueling Jamaica\u2019s Homicide Crisis\",\"summary\":\"\",\"text\":\"CLARENDON, Jamaica \u2014 She came to Jamaica from the United States about four years ago, sneaking in illegally, stowed away to avoid detection. Within a few short years, she became one of the nation\u2019s most-wanted assassins.She preyed on the parish of Clarendon, carrying out nine confirmed kills, including a double homicide outside a bar, the killing of a father at a wake and the murder of a single mother of three. Her violence was indiscriminate: She shot and nearly killed a 14-year-old girl getting ready for church.With few clues to identify her, the police named her Briana. They knew only her country of origin \u2014 the United States \u2014 where she had been virtually untraceable since 1991. She was a phantom, the eighth-most-wanted killer on an island with no shortage of murder, suffering one of the highest homicide rates in the world. And she was only one of thousands.Briana, serial number 245PN70462, was a 9-millimeter Browning handgun.An outbreak of violence is afflicting Jamaica, born of small-time gangs, warring criminals and neighborhood feuds that go back generations \u2014 hand-me-down hatred fueled by pride. This year, the government called a state of emergency to stop the bloodshed in national hot spots, sending the military into the streets.Guns like Briana reside at the epicenter of the crisis. Worldwide, 32 percent of homicides are committed with firearms, according to the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a research group. In Jamaica, the figure is higher than 80 percent. And most of those guns come from the United States, amassed by exploiting loose American gun laws that facilitate the carnage.ImageThe funeral of Pauline Burke-Frazer, a victim of gun violence in Jamaica.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageThe burial of Ms. Burke-Frazer, who was killed with one of the many illegal guns on the street.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesWhile the gun control debate has flared in the United States for decades \u2014 most recently after the mass shootings this month in El Paso and Dayton \u2014 American firearms are pouring into neighboring countries and igniting record violence, in part because of federal and state restrictions that make it difficult, or sometimes nearly impossible, to track the weapons and interrupt smuggling networks.In the United States, the dispute over guns focuses almost exclusively on the policies, consequences and constitutional rights of American citizens, often framed by the assertion \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d \u2014 that the reckless acts of a few should not dictate access for all.But here in Jamaica, there is no such debate. Law enforcement officials, politicians and even gangsters on the street agree: It\u2019s the abundance of guns, typically from the United States, that makes the country so deadly. And while the argument over gun control plays on a continual loop in the United States, Jamaicans say they are dying because of it \u2014 at a rate that is nine times the global average.\u201cMany people in the U.S. see gun control as a purely domestic issue,\u201d said Anthony Clayton, the lead author of Jamaica\u2019s 2014 National Security Policy. But America\u2019s \u201clong-suffering neighbors, whose citizens are being murdered by U.S. weapons, have a very different perspective.\u201dFirearms play such a central role in Jamaican murders that the authorities keep a list of the nation\u2019s 30 deadliest guns, based on ballistic matches. To keep track of them, they are given names, like Ghost or Ambrogio.Some, like Briana, are so poorly documented that the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has nothing more than a piece of paper with the name and details of the original buyer, according to confidential documents reviewed by The New York Times.Purchased in 1991 by a farmer in Greenville, N.C., the Browning vanished from the public record for nearly 24 years \u2014 until it suddenly started wreaking havoc in Jamaica. For three years, its ballistic fingerprint connected it to shootings, mystifying law enforcement. Finally, after a firefight with the police, it was recovered last year and its bloody run came to an end.The authorities traced the serial number back to the handgun\u2019s original owner. But that did not explain how the weapon wound up in Jamaica decades later. Or how the authorities could prevent the next Briana from arriving.The mystery is no accident. By law, licensed gun merchants in the United States are not required to do much more than record retail sales, and usually don\u2019t have to report them to the authorities. After that, if a gun is stolen, lost or handed to someone else, paperwork is only sometimes required.Only a few American states mandate the registration of some or all firearms. Several other states explicitly prohibit it. And there is no national, comprehensive registry of gun ownership. The federal government is forbidden to create one.Drawing on court documents, case files, dozens of interviews and confidential data from law enforcement officials in both countries, The Times traced a single gun \u2014 Briana \u2014 to nine different homicides in Clarendon, a largely rural area of Jamaica where violence has spiked in recent years.It is just one of the hundreds of thousands of guns that leak out of the United States and overwhelm countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 100,000 people are killed every year across the region \u2014 most of them by firearms.\u201cI still love him and miss him all the time,\u201d said Clovis Cooke Sr., weeping over the murder of his son, Clovis Jr., who was gunned down in 2017 with the Browning the authorities call Briana.\u201cHe took care of me,\u201d Mr. Cooke said of his son. \u201cEvery week he would come by and bring food and groceries and pay the bills.\u201dJamaica brims with losses like his. American weapons are routinely funneled into the country aboard ships, flooding cities like Kingston, the capital, where high-grade assault rifles are wielded by warring gangs.ImageA gang member holding a Kalashnikov rifle at a house in Kingston, Jamaica.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageThe police raiding a house in Kingston while looking for a gang member.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesJamaica\u2019s own gun laws are relatively strict, with fewer than 45,000 legal firearms in a country of almost three million.But it is awash in illegal weapons. The Jamaican authorities, who estimate that 200 guns are smuggled into the country from the United States every month, routinely ask American officials to examine some of the weapons they seize in raids, during traffic stops or at the ports.Of the nearly 1,500 weapons the A.T.F. checked from 2016 through 2018, 71 percent came from the United States.The figures are similar in Mexico, which has been lobbying the United States for more than a decade to stop the illegal guns flowing south. By some estimates, more than 200,000 guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, many to feed the vast criminal networks fighting over the multibillion-dollar drug trade to the United States.But here in Jamaica, the killings are rarely driven by such enormous profits. The drug trade has fallen from its heyday, organized crime has been fractured and most of the historic kingpins have been killed or imprisoned.Instead, the guns in Jamaica are often used in petty feuds, neighborhood beefs and turf wars that go back decades, to when political parties authored the majority of the country\u2019s violence.Because guns are so plentiful, small insults and old vendettas that might otherwise leave few casualties grow much more dangerous \u2014 not just for the combatants, but also for anyone who happens to be in the way.\u201cA lot of violence is the result of people settling their disputes, and with all the guns in the country, it is easy to settle things that way,\u201d said Orlando Patterson, a Jamaican-born sociology professor at Harvard University. \u201cThat is where it\u2019s at right now. The early factors, the politics, international drugs, they are gone.\u201dEven some of the gang members agree they are often fighting over small stakes \u2014 and sometimes no financial stakes at all.\u201cI mean, with or without the guns, we will still fight,\u201d said one gang leader in Kingston, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. \u201cBut the guns make it deadlier. There would be a big difference without as many guns.\u201dFrom North Carolina Into Thin AirJohnnie Ray Dunn walked into a North Carolina gun store in the fall of 1991 and purchased an American icon: a 9-millimeter Browning.With its all-steel frame, the gun was built to weather abuse, with a reputation for accuracy and functionality.Mr. Dunn, a farmer, handed over his details and went home with a gun that, if maintained, would last a lifetime.That\u2019s where Briana\u2019s paper trail began \u2014 and ended.President Ronald Reagan had signed a bill that prohibited the creation of any sweeping national gun registry \ufffc\ufffcfive years earlier, a pivotal piece of legislation in the history of American gun law.The National Rifle Association lobbied heavily for the bill, which many saw as a way of expanding gun sales by ensuring easy access to firearms. Underpinning the effort was a warning that still resonates with many of the law\u2019s supporters today: that a national registry would enable the United States government to keep track of gun owners and crack down on their right to bear arms.\u201cIt will be used to take away our guns,\u201d said John Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, explaining one of the main talking points against a national registry.The law effectively ruled out a federal system of tracking all firearms. So when Mr. Dunn\u2019s gun suddenly showed up in Jamaica, linked to a series of homicides from 2015 through early 2018, no one could figure out how it got there.The A.T.F. was unable to trace the gun beyond its initial purchase, and Mr. Dunn would not have been required to report if it had been sold, swapped, lost or stolen. The weapon disappeared into what some experts call the black hole of American gun laws.Mr. Dunn died in 2011, according to a local newspaper obituary, and is not considered a suspect in the gun\u2019s path to Jamaica. The Times attempted to reach his family, without success.Guns like his regularly torment Jamaican officials. Most firearms used in crimes are orphans of a system that seems geared to forget them. Purchased legally, they eventually fall into the vast ocean of what the A.T.F. estimates to be more than 300 million guns circulating in the United States, their chain of ownership often irrevocably broken.\u201cThis is the stereotypical crime gun,\u201d said Joseph Blocher, a professor at Duke University School of Law. \u201cThey almost all originate with a legal sale and are then passed on, stolen or otherwise vanish before reappearing in a crime.\u201dBecause Jamaican officials cannot tell how handguns like the 9-millimeter Browning entered their country \u2014 even with the assistance of American law enforcement \u2014 they struggle to shut down the smuggling rings that fuel the nation\u2019s violence.ImageAmerican weapons are routinely funneled into the country, often by container, flooding cities like Kingston.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAll they know is that, more than 20 years after being sold in North Carolina, the handgun became one of the most lethal in Jamaica, the tool of a one-eyed gangster named Hawk Eye.Samuda Daley got the nickname as a boy. He saw poorly out of one eye, and after an unsuccessful surgery left it covered in a milky film, his alias was born.Mr. Daley was a product of violence, shaped by its near constant presence in his life. As a child, a relative said, his mother was stabbed to death by his uncle.By ninth grade, he had dropped out of school to start working at a sugar factory, telling his family he didn\u2019t want to rely on anyone. He joined the Gaza gang, a clique of young men who had grown up together in a knotted cluster of streets in Clarendon.They began by hanging out, not fighting, his family said. But in the crucible of poverty and desperation, where small conflicts can turn deadly, they ran afoul of a similar group, the King Street gang. The rivalry grew quickly.On Sept. 19, 2015, almost exactly 24 years after Mr. Dunn purchased the gun, the first sign that it had made its way to Jamaica appeared: A man named Okeeve Martin was killed with an unknown 9-millimeter Browning.There was no money or territory at stake, residents say. The motive seemed to be revenge \u2014 the girlfriend of the Gaza gang\u2019s leader had been shot by mistake in an earlier episode.She survived, but the rumor mill led to Mr. Martin, and retribution came swiftly.The gun lay dormant for a year before claiming the life of a 17-year-old, Shane Sewell, on Sept. 6, 2016. He was walking home, having left a bar after a night with friends. He ended up in a ditch, riddled with bullets, some from the mysterious Browning.Officials believe he was killed in a dispute over a different firearm. In Jamaica, guns are often rented out by their owners, as a hardware store might rent out valuable tools. The borrower, looking to commit a robbery or even kill someone, pays a fee to use the weapon. Afterward, the gun is returned. Given a gun\u2019s income potential, when one is lost or stolen, the consequences can be deadly.In the summer of 2017, the Browning struck again. Kurt Mitchell, a fisherman believed to be a member of the King Street gang, was gunned down at a party \u2014 a reprisal for an earlier homicide against the Gaza gang, the authorities believe.His death, in turn, generated still more deaths, in the tragic rhythm that violence often takes in Jamaica.Much of the fighting today stems from political conflicts that stretch back long before the shooters were born. In past decades, armed groups loyal to one of the two major parties \u2014 the Jamaica Labour Party and the People\u2019s National Party \u2014 battled one another for dominance.The patronage networks eventually transitioned to crime, stripped of their political focus. Local leaders, known as Dons, grew incredibly powerful, as deep connections to the United States, Canada and Britain enabled their criminal enterprises to become transnational.But that, too, changed as the government cracked down on the Dons and targeted the drug trade in Jamaica. By 2010, the Dons were all but a thing of the past, with the last major player, Christopher Coke, known locally as Dudus, arrested and extradited to the United States after battles that resulted in the deaths of at least 73 people.\u201c2010 was a watershed moment,\u201d said Damian Hutchinson, the executive director of the Peace Management Initiative, which works to stop violence in Jamaica\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods. \u201cThe Don culture started to change. The political enforcers were now undermined by younger, less conscientious individuals with less purpose to the violence.\u201dImageThe police conducting raids in high-crime areas of downtown Kingston.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageResidents watched during a raid as the police looked for a gang member wanted in connection with weapons charges.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe splintered factions began fighting one another, leading to more \u2014 and more random \u2014 violence. Wars broke out between once-aligned blocks and the gangs multiplied, to more than 250 nationwide today.Those armed factions, fighting a small-scale war, have lifted homicides to new peaks.The 9-millimeter Browning became a terrifying facet of this landscape, with evidence tying it to more than eight homicide scenes.As officials tried to stitch together the clues, the gun was repeatedly being used as an enforcement tool of the Gaza gang, often by Mr. Daley, the killer known as Hawk Eye.He was quiet, never bragging about his exploits, residents and family members said. He didn\u2019t need to. His ruthlessness was well known, and neighbors afforded him a grudging respect.Mr. Daley had become embroiled in a personal feud with another gangster, Christopher Lynch, and some of the shootings that plagued Clarendon in 2017 came from their hatred for each other, officials say.They had once been close friends, almost like family, relatives said, but that former intimacy now burned with an equally intense hostility. Mr. Daley tried to kill him on a Sunday in 2017, when he spotted him walking home from a soccer game.He fired at Mr. Lynch, who took off running through the woods and escaped, officials say. But a stray bullet struck a 14-year-old girl in the stomach as she prepared for church. Luckily, the girl survived.Months later, Mr. Lynch\u2019s father was at a wake, a late-night affair with drinks and music, a celebration of life common in parts of Jamaica. At around 10:30 p.m., investigators now believe, Mr. Daley stormed the wake and began shooting. The elder Lynch died. Three others were injured.Once again, the bullet fragments connected the shootings to the 9 millimeter.From Idaho to Montego BayNot all guns vanish without a trace and suddenly reappear, decades later. Some are bought openly and sent overseas right away.From late 2016 through early 2017, a 74-year-old man from Idaho purchased three military-style rifles and a Glock .45 pistol in Meridian, Idaho, a town of about 100,000 people surrounded by more than two dozen gun stores.Six months later, all four guns were recovered by the Jamaican authorities in a raid in the Montego Bay area, where criminal violence has overwhelmed the parish of St. James.The area is a notable exception to Jamaica\u2019s vendetta violence. A multimillion-dollar scamming industry has flourished there, inciting so many homicides that the government sent in the military.ImageA cemetery in Kingston where numerous gang members have been buried.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageThe police patrolling in downtown Kingston. The Jamaican authorities have struggled to trace weapons, including many bought legally in the United States.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe scammers \u2014 who swindle American citizens into sending money or divulging their bank account information \u2014 are well financed and capable of building armories to battle their competitors.The weapons, like other illicit arms in Jamaica, arrive in containers aboard the hundreds of ships that come to the island each month. Often, they slip through in small batches, broken down into parts and hidden in freezers or car engines to evade inspectors.Of course, not all illegal guns in Latin America and the Caribbean come from the United States. In some countries, including those with weapons left over from civil wars, fewer than half of the illicit weapons trace back to American soil.But firearms trafficking from the United States is such a big problem that the A.T.F. says it is dedicated to fighting it. Commercial traffic between the United States and Jamaica has become more closely surveilled in recent years, so smugglers have started bringing in the guns through Haiti, too, often in exchange for marijuana or even meat.Criminal networks, like those in the scamming industry, also turn to straw buyers in the United States \u2014 people who purchase the guns legally and send them to Jamaica, either complicit, misled or uninterested in how they are used.The Idaho man may have been a victim of the scammers himself. Officials say the swindlers appear to have pressured him into buying the weapons, promising to return his pilfered savings.It was the Glock .45 that caught the attention of American and Jamaican authorities. Only three months after the Idaho man purchased it, the gun was already in Jamaica \u2014 and had killed Jeffrey Cato, a 39-year-old mentally ill man, on March 17, 2017.Mr. Cato, a beloved figure in the community of Flankers, had no obvious enemies. He seemed to float in his own space, neighbors said, harmless and uninvolved.On the day of his death, Mr. Cato was getting food for one of his children. The police never identified a motive, but believe he may have witnessed a murder.\u201cHe had no gang connections whatsoever,\u201d said one detective, speaking anonymously because the investigation was still open. \u201cIn my eight years working, there\u2019s only a few cases that still stick with me. This is one of them.\u201dLast July, the gun was used again, to kill Nicholas Kerr, a quiet 41-year-old who lived in the basement of his mother\u2019s home. He was shot at a corner store, buying a soda.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had enemies here,\u201d said Mr. Kerr\u2019s mother, withholding her name for fear of retribution. \u201cBut Nicholas?\u201d she added. \u201cHe was peaceful.\u201d\u2018Every Day They Kill People\u2019Joviane Hall was D.J.-ing at a local bar near Clarendon at 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 6, 2017, when gunmen burst in without warning.After robbing the bar and its patrons, they opened fire, hitting Mr. Hall, who died on the way to the hospital. Officials recognized the culprit, a weapon they had come to loathe: the Browning.The murder was the beginning of a spree. Two days later, another shooting occurred at the Three Sisters Bar. At around 10:50 p.m., two friends, Clovis Cooke and Otis Gordon, were standing outside, drinking, when a car pulled up.The shooter fired 21 shots and sped off. Investigators found yet another set of 9-millimeter fragments.Every murder committed, every life taken, left a wound that never healed. Ten minutes from the Three Sisters Bar, which is now dormant and overgrown with dense foliage, Mr. Cooke\u2019s parents live in their simple, vinyl-sided home off the side of the highway.His father, recovering from cataract surgery, plodded around in the dark, searching for overdue bills in the drift of papers on the small dining table.Image\u201cI still love him and miss him all the time,\u201d said Clovis Cooke Sr., as he recounted the murder of his son, Clovis Jr., who was gunned down in 2017 with the 9-millimeter Browning the authorities call Briana.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesHe wept at the mention of his son, 33, who used to pay the bills and help out around the house. Married at 15, his parents grew up raising him. But time had inverted their roles, and now, without him, they were nearly destitute.\u201cI think about him everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day they kill people,\u201d he said, \u201cand every day we grieve about it.\u201dThe same void haunted the home where Jody Ann Harvey was killed less than two months after Mr. Cooke, in what some believe was a case of mistaken identity.Gunmen charged into her one-room shack, kicking open the door and firing on Ms. Harvey and her daughter as they slept in the small bed they shared. Ms. Harvey covered the girl with her body, taking six 9-millimeter rounds in the hail of gunfire. Her daughter survived.Last spring, the home still sat abandoned in a thicket of trees, its wooden stairwell rotting, its blue and green paint blistered. Ashley Wilson, Ms. Harvey\u2019s sister, had come by \u2014 to visit, to fill the single room with memories. To mourn.\u201cI just miss her, I guess,\u201d she said, swinging the rickety door open. \u201cI go inside, into her room, where it happened. It brings back a lot of memories. I\u2019ll look at pictures of her, listen to music we liked, talk to her daughter. This is how it goes.\u201dThe deadly run of the Browning ended, in some ways, the way it began.Joy Commock, the girlfriend of the Gaza gang\u2019s leader \u2014 the person who had been shot by mistake and survived, starting the cycle of revenge that first set the handgun loose on Jamaica \u2014 was killed on Jan. 21, 2018.The casings matched the earlier crimes: The gun killed Ms. Commock as well, officials say.She was home alone with her daughter when she heard a noise, the police say. It was just after midnight and the smell of smoke filled the air.She raced outside and found a fire burning in her front yard. She knelt to extinguish the flames, and was shot multiple times by an assailant hiding in the shadows.Her daughter, one of three, hid inside. When the girl emerged, her mother was dead, lying face down in the yard.\u201cShe was the sole breadwinner,\u201d said Ms. Commock\u2019s sister, Lotoya Evans. \u201cThey were her life.\u201d\u201cThey expect you to forget about it, but when you lose somebody, you don\u2019t just get up and act normal,\u201d she added, holding her own daughter tight.By early 2018, the authorities were still no closer to finding the gun. They knew its caliber, and even the conflict the gun was caught in. But while Mr. Daley, the enforcer known as Hawk Eye, was still alive, no witnesses dared to testify.At around 11 p.m. on April 28, an off-duty policeman was having a drink at a local bar in Clarendon when two men showed up to rob it. One of them was Mr. Daley, who flashed the Browning at patrons and demanded money. The officer drew on the two men and announced himself, officials say.Mr. Daley turned and fired, but the policeman had the drop on both men, killing Mr. Daley on the spot.And like that, the gun was off the streets.Witnesses came forward to link Mr. Daley to other shootings, officials say, and the police later asked the A.T.F. to run a trace on his weapon.It led all the way to North Carolina, to a time before Mr. Daley was even born.ImageA street in Kingston.
