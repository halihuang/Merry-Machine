Denny Tamaki, the governor of Okinawa, said he was shocked by the number of infections and said it was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d that so many cases had emerged among American troops and affiliated personnel in less than a week. Excluding the American cases, Okinawa has recorded just 148 infections since February.Mr. Tamaki added that he had \u201cstrong doubts\u201d about the prevention measures reported by the United States.Japan, which has been relatively successful in containing the virus, has also experienced a recent surge of new cases concentrated in Tokyo, where a state of emergency was lifted at the end of May. Tokyo reported two consecutive days of record daily infections last week, with a large number of cases among people in their 20s and 30s who worked in or had visited venues in Tokyo\u2019s nightlife districts.The United States military in South Korea also announced on Monday that 11 troops had tested positive upon arrival from the United States. The American military has struggled with outbreaks among its troops, with a major cluster of infections in March on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.The Japanese military, by contrast, has reported just 14 cases among its defense forces, all of whom are thought to have contracted the virus in their communities rather than while deployed. The cases in Okinawa are a new strain on relations between the military and the local government, where the presence of American bases, dating to the end of World War II, has been an ongoing source of friction. Citizens have long complained of noise, crime and aircraft accidents, and have repeatedly questioned why nearly half of the 55,000 American troops in Japan \u2014 which include personnel from all of the military branches \u2014 are stationed on Okinawa.ImageResidents pray near a memorial commemorating the 1945 battle of Okinawa.
