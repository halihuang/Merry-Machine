The police interviewed the victim and her lawyer for almost 10 hours until early Thursday. Ms. Go also demanded that Seoul City Hall launch an investigation on why it had dismissed the secretary\u2019s earlier complaints of sexual harassment.\u201cWhen she appealed for help with City Hall, officials there just tried to protect the mayor, saying that he would never have done such a thing or that she should dismiss it like a minor mistake,\u201d said Lee Mi-kyeong, head of the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center, another women\u2019s right group. \u201cThis is a typical case of sexual violence where the victim faces a tremendous power and is blocked from raising an issue.\u201dSeoul City Hall did not immediately respond to the demand for an investigation.In South Korea, men dominate society\u2019s upper echelons, enforcing a strictly hierarchical code. The culture can make women vulnerable to\u200b sexual\u200b abuse and make it difficult to speak out.As in other countries, the #MeToo movement has rippled across South Korea in recent years. Women have come forward with accusations of sexual abuse against an array of prominent men, including theater directors, politicians, professors, religious leaders and a former coach for the national speedskating team.ImageA police forensic team carrying the body of Mr. Park after it was found last week.Credit...Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesMany of the accused have apologized and resigned from their positions.
