"{\"title\":\"Liar, Liar, Nation on Fire\",\"summary\":\"I\u2019m positive that Trump\u2019s toxic.\",\"text\":\"WASHINGTON \u2014 Sleepy Joe and Creepy Joe haven\u2019t worked. So now they\u2019re trying Sticky-Fingered Joe.After Joe Biden gave his big economic speech in Dunmore, Pa., they pounced.\u201cHe plagiarized from me but he could never pull it off,\u201d President Trump told reporters as he left Friday for a Florida fund-raiser. \u201cHe likes plagiarizing.\u201dKellyanne Conway told Fox News that Biden\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d pitch was \u201crich with irony.\u201d\u201cLook, this is Joe Biden plagiarizing Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,\u201d Conway said of the time Biden lifted lines from the British politician, during his first presidential run. \u201cTwo days ago,\u201d she added, \u201che\u2019s plagiarizing Bernie Sanders, and yesterday he\u2019s plagiarizing Donald Trump, Buy American.\u201d\u201cBuy American\u201d is a slogan that House Democrats have used for many years, so if anyone is swiping it, it\u2019s Trump. And Joe and Bernie coming together on proposals is not plagiarism.As to Kinnock, Kellyanne, I know a little something about that. That was my front-page Times story back in 1987. Biden, as he did on other occasions, got swept away with puffing himself up and sprinted over the factual line. He overidentified with aspects of Kinnock\u2019s life in Wales \u2014 fusing their backgrounds \u2014 and borrowed some Celtic lyricism.I wrote another story at the same time about Biden lifting chunks of Robert Kennedy speeches. But that was the fault of his speechwriter Pat Caddell, who sprinkled in R.F.K. passages without Biden knowing.Biden dropped out of the race. I ran into him on a back stairway in the Senate when he was getting ready for his news conference. We looked at each other but did not speak. I figured he\u2019d never speak to me again.I was wrong. One of his top aides yelled at me and told me I wouldn\u2019t be allowed into Robert Bork\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which Biden was chairing. But Biden himself was friendly and fair to me afterward, even when I wrote pieces that were highly critical of the way he conducted the Anita Hill hearings and ripped on him for his hair plugs. He was so un-vengeful that I began to doubt he was really Irish. (His middle name is Robinette, after all.)Biden has a talent for messes and has made some bad judgment calls \u2014 including voting to authorize the Iraq war.But when David Axelrod told me that Barack Obama was leaning toward putting Biden on the ticket, I thought it was a fine idea. I felt that Obama made a mistake nudging him aside in 2016 \u2014 I think he would have beaten Trump.Biden\u2019s gaffes, logorrhea, puffery and handsiness are part of the messy package that is Uncle Joe. So are his empathy, sentimentality and loyalty.Biden\u2019s fabulist flights were an effort to make himself look better. Trump\u2019s are more audacious \u2014 and dangerous. It\u2019s the difference between fibs and whoppers, white lies and white supremacy.Every day, Trump wakes up and constructs an alternative universe where his crowds are bigger, his poll results are better, the virus is evaporating, the testing is fantastic, it\u2019s totally safe for kids to go back to school, and he\u2019s doing the greatest job of any president in history.\u201cToxic positivity,\u201d the president\u2019s niece Mary Trump calls it in her new family memoir, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough,\u201d which exposes the gruesome underbelly of the president\u2019s gilded facade.Mary Trump is the daughter of the president\u2019s older brother, Fred Jr., who died an alcoholic after a lifetime of his father\u2019s abuse. With a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, she diagnoses her Uncle Donald as a narcissist, of course, but also quite possibly having \u201cantisocial personality disorder.\u201d\u201cThe country is now suffering from the same toxic positivity that my grandfather deployed specifically to drown out his ailing wife, torment his dying son, and damage past healing the psyche of his favorite child, Donald J. Trump,\u201d she concludes. The inability of the \u201ccourt jester from Queens,\u201d as Mary calls him, to succeed without being heavily subsidized by his father created a tension where he knew he was inadequate but could never admit it.\u201cAt a very deep level,\u201d Mary writes, \u201chis bragging and false bravado are not directed at the audience in front of him but at his audience of one: his long-dead father.\u201dA Washington Post story a few days ago underscored her point that he is the same \u201cdesperate\u201d little boy. The story recounted that Trump sees himself as a victim of the pandemic, and his mood is so \u201cwoe is me\u201d that advisers tried to cheer him up with special events \u2014 \u201cbringing 18-wheelers onto the White House South Lawn in mid-April or creating social media videos that feature throngs of his adoring fans.\u201dHis father\u2019s racism infected Donald, and the patriarch promoted a warped idea of manliness. Donald\u2019s cracks about \u201cugly women\u201d and his disrespectful behavior in business were meant to make him look tough.Fred Jr. was destroyed by it. But Donald is trying to destroy us with it, with his absurd philosophy that masks are unmanly.ImageJoe Biden, face mask at the ready.Credit...Christopher Dolan/The Times-Tribune, via Associated PressBiden, who assiduously stays masked, has never been a divider. Indeed, there were times, as with the Anita Hill hearings and the Iraq war vote, that he leaned too far into comity.But Trump divides with feral pleasure. \u201cThe atmosphere of division my grandfather created in the Trump family is the water in which Donald has always swum,\u201d Mary Trump writes, \u201cand division continues to benefit him at the expense of everybody else.\u201dThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
