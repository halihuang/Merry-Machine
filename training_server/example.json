For many in the opposition, the race was not only a contest between competing visions for Poland, but a last chance to save institutions that form the bedrock of a healthy democracy.While the tight vote underscored the extent to which the deep divisions in Poland have only intensified after five years governed by the Law and Justice party, there was no suggestion the government would now change course.Mr. Duda\u2019s promise to protect \u201ctraditional families\u201d resonated with older voters and churchgoers, especially in the eastern half of the country, helping him fend off a fierce challenge from Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw.The opposition was fueled by support from young people around the country, securing a majority of votes from people under 50, and turnout was among the highest since the country turned away from communism.Poland\u2019s major cities, from Gdansk in the north to Krakow in the south, were bastions of resistance, but the governing party rallied its faithful in rural communities, many left behind in the rapid transition from communism to capitalism.Mr. Trzaskowski conceded defeat Monday afternoon after the country\u2019s electoral commission said that with 100 percent of the actual vote counted, Mr. Duda had secured 51.03 percent of the vote. Mr. Trzaskowski won 48.97 percent. The turnout was 68.18 percent.ImageMayor Rafal Trzaskowski of Warsaw, who was supported by young people around the country, lost the election by an extremely thin margin.Credit...Pawel Supernak/EPA, via ShutterstockWhile Mr. Duda struck a conciliatory tone in remarks to supporters on Sunday, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Monday that Mr. Duda would continue to advance the government\u2019s agenda, which he described as \u201cpro-family policies,\u201d a focus on social issues and \u201ca more just redistribution\u201d of wealth.\u201cMost important,\u201d he said, \u201cis to complete the judiciary reform and other state bodies, so everything is more professional, faster.\u201dWriting on Twitter, Mr. Trzaskowski thanked the roughly 10 million people who voted for him, but conceded the contest. It was a bitter defeat for opponents of the government.The Warsaw mayor was not even a candidate when the election was postponed in May because of the coronavirus, but he mounted a serious challenge against an incumbent president who had the backing of state television and important church leaders.With the next parliamentary elections not scheduled until 2023, Mr. Duda\u2019s re-election ensured that the governing party, which also controls the Parliament, will be able to continue to reshape the nation in ways that critics contend undermine open political debate and the rule of law, and put it at odds with the European Union, which has accused Poland of damaging democratic values and institutions.Mr. Trzaskowski had cast the election as a fight for the soul of the nation. He promised to end a government that uses state media to promote its views and silence opposing voices, manipulates the courts and uses fear and division to build support.The mayor, whose campaign rallies were as likely to feature the blue and gold of the European Union flag as the red and white of Poland, said he wanted to live in a country where \u201can open hand wins against a clenched fist.\u201dMr. Duda, however, dismissed concerns about Poland\u2019s illiberal drift as an invention of foreign interests. He attacked Mr. Trzaskowski over his support for L.G.B.T. rights \u2014 a powerful argument in a staunchly Catholic country, particularly outside its cosmopolitan cities.ImageVoting in Poland\u2019s presidential election runoff on Sunday in Warsaw.Credit...Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesThomas Boserup, an independent election observer from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the voting and counting process was carried out well and all the coronavirus precautions were observed. But he said that there were threats reported against journalists and politicians.\u201cThe polarization was illustrated by the fact that candidates did not participate in one debate, depriving the voters from comparing their views,\u201d he said, noting that public television had failed in its duty to impartially cover the election. \u201cWe were worried by instances of intolerant rhetoric of a homophobic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic nature, particularly among the president\u2019s campaign and the public television.\u201dMr. Duda\u2019s campaign received a boost recently from President Trump, who met with him at the White House just days before the election and all but endorsed him. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a terrific job,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the incumbent. \u201cThe people of Poland think the world of him.\u201dAn already bitter campaign turned even uglier in the final days before Sunday\u2019s vote, with Mr. Duda, the Law and Justice party and its supporters in the right-wing media launching a barrage of attacks on Mr. Trzaskowski.In the pro-government weekly Sieci, the Warsaw mayor was accused of supporting pedophilia. State television, which has been turned into a propaganda machine for the government, suggested that Mr. Trzaskowski would be controlled by Jewish interests in complicated questions related to restitution of property dating from World War II.Xenophobic arguments are nothing new for Law and Justice, which took power in 2015 on a campaign against accepting migrants, has described itself as defending Christianity against foreign forces, and has tarred the European Union as a threat to national autonomy. But appeals tinged with anti-Semitism, in a country whose Jews were largely wiped out in the Holocaust, were generally off-limits until recently.Independent news outlets faced escalating attacks during the campaign, with the governing party claiming that Germany and other outside powers were trying to meddle in Poland\u2019s affairs.\u201cHave you ever heard such homophobia, such anti-Semitism, such attacks on everybody who is brave enough to say \u2018We have had enough\u2019?\u201d Mr. Trzaskowski asked supporters on Friday.\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d he said.ImageL.G.B.T. youth participating in a flashmob in Warsaw in June.

Both were born in 1972 and raised by families considered part of the country\u2019s intelligentsia, and both were academics before entering politics as ministers in the European Union.But their visions for the nation of roughly 38 million could hardly have been more different. Those differences echoed debates playing out in other nations, where traditional democratic values like pluralism have come under assault from populist leaders who undermine institutions and civil society to concentrate power.While the Polish president has limited authority, the office comes with veto power, which Mr. Trzaskowski vowed to use to provide a counterweight to Law and Justice.The leader of the Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, speaking on a popular Catholic broadcast station, accused the Warsaw mayor of lacking a \u201cPolish soul\u201d and a \u201cPolish heart.\u201d\u201cThose who currently push to seize power \u2014 at present in the presidential elections, but it\u2019s a known fact that it\u2019s not only about that \u2014 these are people who question everything which constitutes our tradition,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said on Friday. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to have decisions being made somewhere outside of the Polish borders.\u201dWhile the coronavirus led to a delay in the election, allowing Mr. Trzaskowski to enter the race in May, it was not a major focus of the campaign.Still, the precautions taken at polling stations \u2014 including social-distancing requirements \u2014 were a reminder of the lingering threat. And with Law and Justice drawing much of its support from older voters, the party redoubled its efforts to ensure that fear of the virus would not limit turnout.\u201cI can assure you, like many others have, that participation in these elections is really absolutely safe,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said. \u201cIt\u2019s even safer than going to the grocery store.\u201dAn alert from the Government Security Center, which normally sends out text messages warning of bad weather, was delivered to Polish mobile phones on Saturday reminding people of the elections. \u201cPeople over the age of 60+, pregnant women and disabled people are entitled to vote at the polling stations without waiting in line,\u201d the alert noted.In the end, it was older voters that gave Mr. Duda the edge he needed.

Only 15 of the wounded were intelligence officers and the rest civilians.\u201cThe blast was so strong that it broke people\u2019s windows three kilometers away,\u201d Mr. Samangani said. \u201cThe building of the intelligence agency and the municipality building are not usable anymore.\u201d Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, confirmed that the insurgency was behind the attack.A major attack inside a city seems to breach an understanding between the United States and the Taliban, which signed a preliminary peace deal in February that begun the withdrawal of American forces. And it broke with the Taliban tactics in recent months of escalating violence in the countryside without claiming many of the attacks, while the cities were largely spared except for hit-and-run assassinations. ImageAfghan security personnel inspecting the site of a car bomb blast near the destroyed office building of Afghanistan's intelligence agency on Monday.\u00a0Credit...Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesThe deal, in which the Taliban guaranteed that they would not attack American targets, has faced criticism because it lacked any guarantee of a cease-fire with Afghans. But American officials have said that they had an understanding with the Taliban that the insurgents would reduce their levels of violence by as much as 80 percent and not attack in major cities and population centers.Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, called on the Taliban to stop what he described as \u201ccriminal and inhumane\u201d attacks that could derail the peace efforts. \u201cTurning to violence and killing people for leverage in negotiations is the worst approach that, unfortunately, the Taliban have taken up,\u201d Mr. Ghani said in a statement.The violence continues unabated as the poor nation grapples with the spread of Covid-19 and its economic ramifications. Although official numbers are dubious, with testing capacity extremely low, the country\u2019s health ministry has recorded nearly 35,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths.The February deal was expected to open the way within 10 days for the more complicated part of the peace process: talks with the Afghan government over a future power-sharing agreement. But those talks have been repeatedly delayed over complications with a prisoner swap that was laid out as a precondition for negotiations. The American deal with the Taliban called for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for 1,000 Afghan security forces held by the insurgents \u2014 a clause that angered many Afghan officials.After balking for weeks, the Afghan government began a phased release of Taliban prisoners, under heavy pressure from the Trump administration. But with more than 4,000 Taliban released, the last stretch is once again facing difficulty, as the Afghan government says it cannot release about 500 of those on the Taliban list because they are deemed dangerous and are accused of serious crimes.Javid Faisal, a spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s National Security Council, said the government has proposed that the Taliban suggest new names instead of the 592 that cannot be released. It is unclear whether the insurgents have agreed to that.\u201cWe have told them that we are ready to release alternative people,\u201d Mr. Faisal said.The ongoing attack in Samangan caps a bloody 24 hours in northern Afghanistan, where Taliban launched attacks in several provinces, officials said.At least 20 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in overnight assaults in two districts of Kunduz Province. In Badakhshan Province, the Taliban attacked security posts in Arghanj Khwa district, killing at least seven from the security forces.Fahim Abed contributed reporting."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/coronavirus-updates.html", "title": "Coronavirus Live Updates: California Imposing Sweeping Rollback of Reopening Plans Amid Case Surges ", "summary": "", "authors": "", "text": "Here\u2019s what you need to know:Amid surging cases, California imposes a sweeping rollback of its reopening plans. 17 states join legal effort to block a rule that revokes visas from foreign students taking virtual classes.A new week begins with a grim outlook: More than 100,000 new cases were identified over the weekend.As Fauci becomes more vocal, Trump aides are moving to undercut him.A Los Angeles Apparel factory that made masks is shut after 300 workers test positive.Hong Kong closes gyms and cinemas, and bans gatherings of more than four to stem a new outbreak.The W.H.O. head says \u2018mixed messages\u2019 from leaders are undermining trust, and discusses world hunger.ImageDrivers lining up virus testing in Los Angeles.

With cases surging in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced one of the most sweeping rollbacks of any state\u2019s reopening plans, saying Monday that he would move to close indoor operations statewide for restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, zoos and card rooms, and bars would be force to close all operations.And the governor said that in at least 30 of the hardest counties, business would be forced to close indoor operations for fitness centers, places of worship, non-critical offices, hair salons and barbershops and malls. Roughly 80 percent of the state\u2019s population lives in the affected counties, Mr. Newsom said.California was averaging more than 8,000 new cases a day as of Sunday, more than double what it was a month ago. The state has seen 331,626 cases, the second highest tally in the nation, and more than 7,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database.\u201cWe\u2019re going back into modification mode of our original stay at home order,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cThis continues to be a deadly disease.\u201dMr. Newsom emphasized that state officials have repeatedly said the state\u2019s reopening process would be more akin to a \u201cdimmer switch\u201d than an on or off switch. In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said Monday that she would ban indoor gatherings of more than 10 people for things like birthday parties, potlucks, book clubs and dinner gatherings. She said the new ban would not apply to the operations of businesses or churches \u201cat this time.\u201dMr. Newsom made the announcement after California\u2019s two largest public school districts said Monday that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers.The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enroll some 825,000 students, are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August.More than a third of California\u2019s coronavirus cases are in Los Angeles County and San Diego County has had 18 community outbreaks over the past week, more than double the state\u2019s acceptable threshold.The joint announcement came as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to press the Trump administration\u2019s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students\u2019 social and emotional development, but so that parents can return to work fully.The recommendations from the president and Ms. DeVos have been disputed by many public health officials and teachers. On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association issued a statement saying that reopening recommendations should be \u201cbased on evidence, not politics.\u201dThe groups added that \u201cwe should leave it to health experts to tell us when the time is best to open up school buildings, and listen to educators and administrators to shape how we do it.\u201dIn the Los Angeles and San Diego districts\u2019 joint statement, they noted that while much has been learned about the virus, many recommendations and findings are vague and contradictory.But \u201cone fact is clear,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThose countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available.

The driver crashed the passenger bus, the police said, to send a message.\u201cDue to his dissatisfaction with his life\u2019s circumstances and the demolition of rented public housing and in order to cause a stir, he has committed extreme crimes that endanger public safety,\u201d the police report said.The authorities said the driver had rented a 430-square-foot unit in a state-owned public housing structure included in a redevelopment scheme. He signed an agreement in June to receive $10,000 in compensation, but did not claim the sum. His applications for public housing were rejected, but plans for the demolition of the building went forward.The case shines a light on the often-silent victims displaced by China\u2019s urban redevelopment schemes, in which state-sponsored developers tear down older, shabbier buildings in dilapidated neighborhoods to build gleaming office towers, shopping malls and expensive housing.On Tuesday morning, the bus driver called a government hotline to complain that his home was about to be demolished before he could receive government housing, the police report said.He then traded shifts with a colleague and bought some baijiu, a colorless alcoholic drink, that he took to work in a water bottle. He left some voice messages for his girlfriend on WeChat, expressing weariness and disgust with the world, and sipped from the bottle before starting his shift, the police report said.Security video showed the bus cutting across three lanes of oncoming traffic around midday Tuesday as it traveled along Hongshan Lake in Anshun. It then plunged down a series of low terraces and into the lake, becoming submerged by more than 30 feet of water.Some passengers were students preparing to take the gaokao, the national college placement test, reported The Paper, a state-run online publication based in Shanghai. At least five of those killed were students, officials said.The gaokao, which began on Tuesday, was delayed for a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 10 million students are participating this year.Caixin, a Chinese-language magazine, published an article on Friday about the demolition of the bus driver\u2019s home and his efforts to stop it.

The gunman had posted a white-supremacist manifesto online and live-streamed part of the shootings on Facebook.On Monday, a judge at Christchurch\u2019s High Court confirmed that Mr. Tarrant, who appeared via video link from Auckland Prison, had waived his rights to legal representation before allowing his lawyers, Jonathan Hudson and Shane Tait, to withdraw from the case, according to the local news media.\u201cWe are not disappointed by Mr. Tarrant\u2019s decision,\u201d Mr. Hudson said, according to The New Zealand Herald. \u201cThere has been no conflict or relationship breakdown.\u201d Instead, the court will appoint a lawyer on standby should Mr. Tarrant choose to be represented later.By representing himself, Mr. Tarrant will be entitled to speak at the sentencing, although the judge has the power to determine what is relevant to the hearing, Len Andersen, the president of the New Zealand Criminal Bar Association, told the local news outlet Stuff.

The tests came back negative, but many of his colleagues at the Mississippi State Capitol were not as lucky \u2014 the virus has infected 26 lawmakers, including the lieutenant governor and the House speaker. Cases have surged statewide \u2014 the state has averaged more than 700 new cases daily \u2014 and intensive care units at many of the state\u2019s largest hospitals are near capacity.\u201cI have taken to replacing sleeping with praying,\u201d Mr. Reeves, an accountant before he got into politics, told reporters.The pandemic has put Mr. Reeves, a Republican, and many of America\u2019s governors of both parties under a spotlight for which none of their aides and consultants have a playbook. Interviews with aides, advisers and others involved in the coronavirus response efforts of seven governors revealed just how much the crisis has upended their offices, their lives, and how they approach the job. For some, it has magnified their weaknesses and drawn out tensions even within their own parties \u2014 and their own kitchen cabinets.The crisis reached a boiling point this month for some governors, as the virus spread and deaths increased in a swath of states that governors had reopened. By this week, the outbreak was growing across 39 states, from hotspots across the Sunbelt to new surges emerging in the nation\u2019s middle. Florida reported the highest single-day total of new virus cases of any state \u2014 more than 15,000 \u2014 since the start of the pandemic. And leaders in some places, including one county in Texas, have been calling for a return of stay-at-home orders amid surges of new virus cases. Reversing course \u2014 a practice governors prefer not to be seen doing \u2014 has become routine in the age of coronavirus on policies around masks, crowds, bars and more.ImageGov.

Fearing she would get infected on the train that took her to the lab every day, she moved from her apartment in East Harlem to an Airbnb five minutes from the company\u2019s headquarters in Tarrytown, in Westchester County.Then her mother, a nurse\u2019s assistant who cared for newborn babies at a Long Island hospital, was reassigned to a Covid-19 ward where she tended to older people struggling to breathe. No drug could help these patients \u2014\u00a0or her, if she were to get sick, too.\u201cI had somebody on the line that I really cared about,\u201d Ms. Giordano said recently. \u201cAnd I wanted to see her make it through this.\u201dMs. Giordano, the youngest member of the company\u2019s five-person rapid response team for infectious diseases, helped develop what many consider one of the most promising new treatments for Covid-19, which has now infected more than 12 million people around the world, and killed more than 549,000.She worked in the lab until 10 many nights and through weekends, screening thousands of antibodies \u2014 the weapons of the immune system that seek out and destroy viruses \u2014 in search of the most powerful ones. The result was a cocktail of two antibodies that might not only treat the virus, but prevent it by giving the body the same natural defenses that people infected with it produce on their own.The Trump administration this week gave a major boost to Regeneron\u2019s treatment, awarding the company $450 million to manufacture and supply as many as 300,000 doses as treatments or 1.3 million doses to prevent infection. That\u2019s in addition to $160 million in federal money the company had already received to run clinical trials and ramp up manufacturing. After the treatment passed an initial safety study, Regeneron\u2019s broader trials to evaluate the product\u2019s efficacy got underway.ImageThe Westchester campus of the pharmaceutical company Regeneron.Credit...Melissa Bunni Elian for The New York TimesDr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, recently singled out the treatment as the most likely to pan out soon. \u201cIf I had to pick one, I think the monoclonal antibody cocktails have a lot going for them,\u201d Dr. Collins said at a Senate hearing last week. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons to think this is the kind of virus it should work for.\u201dIf the trials are successful, company executives have said the treatment could be available by the end of the summer. The hope is that it could serve as a stopgap until a vaccine arrives by providing temporary protection to people at high risk of getting infected.Regeneron is making a significant gamble, ramping up manufacturing of the antibody cocktail before clinical trials have even proved that it works. The most lucrative drugs it makes for other diseases have been relocated to a factory in Ireland.Regeneron is one of several companies pursuing monoclonal antibody treatments. The drug giant Eli Lilly has also begun clinical trials, and others working on antibody treatments include partnerships of Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies and also Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline.It\u2019s unclear which of these projects \u2014 if any \u2014 will succeed.

The demonstrations tapered off when the country shut down because of the coronavirus but have recently picked up again as the lockdown has added to the economic distress.The effects of the economic meltdown are increasingly infiltrating the daily lives of many Lebanese. Power cuts darken streets, banks refuse to hand over depositors\u2019 cash and families struggle to buy imported essentials like diapers and laundry detergent.The government has long failed to provide sufficient electricity. But blackouts have grown so long that the din of traffic in Beirut, where about one-third of Lebanon\u2019s 5.4 million people live, has been replaced by the roar of overworked generators.Their exhaust fouls the air, and many residential buildings are shutting them off to rest at night, depriving residents of air-conditioning during the sweatiest stretch of the Mediterranean summer.For two days recently, Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the main facility treating Beirut\u2019s Covid-19 cases, suddenly went from one hour without power per day to 20 hours without power, according to its director, Dr. Firass Abiad.So the hospital, which now lacks power six hours a day, has closed some operating rooms and delayed surgeries.\u201cIt feels like you are continuously firefighting with no end in sight,\u201d Dr. Abiad said.ImageThe capital city, Beirut, during a power outage of more than six hours last\u00a0 week.Credit...Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York TimesAfter dark, Beirut\u2019s once-raucous nightlife has given way to an eerie desolation.

Now, many wonder how far their standard of living will fall.\u201cBeirut is a survival city. People always find ways to eat and drink and make music and do activism.

It\u2019s like you take your salary and divide it by nine.\u201dThe Lebanese pound, or lira, has lost about 85 percent of its value on the black market since last fall, getting its own satirical Twitter feed where it reacts to its own decline.\u201cI\u2019m the cheapest but I\u2019m not a piece of junk,\u201d the account said early this month amid reports that it was trading at 9,500 to the U.S. dollar, far from the official bank rate of 1,500.Much of the financial distress comes from chaos in the banking system. The central bank ran what critics have called a Ponzi scheme, enticing commercial banks to make large deposits of U.S. dollars with high interest rates that could be covered only by bringing in more large depositors with even higher interest rates.But that system ground to a halt last year when new investors stopped coming, leaving the country\u2019s banks far short of thedollars they owed their depositors.The banks have reacted by mostly refusing to give out dollars, which the Lebanese had long used interchangeably with local currency in daily life.A former Lebanese banker, Dan Azzi, has taken credit for coining a term now widely used for these theoretical dollars that exist only in Lebanese banks: Lollars.The result has been financial pandemonium, and pain.ImageRising levels of hunger amid a major currency slide have brought protesters back onto the streets after a tapering off during the coronavirus lockdown.Credit...Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York TimesThe government has sought to control the black market exchange, where changing money on better terms than the official rate can feel like buying drugs, requiring quick meetings in alleyways with money-changers who use fake names and fear arrest.The effects of the crisis on the country\u2019s poor have been acute, as was made clear by four recent suicides in one two-day period, all linked to the economic crisis.

Its complexion is parched and blemished. Traffic clogs its throbbing arteries. It has signs of major stress.The coronavirus obliged. Three months of lockdown, including an 11-hour nightly curfew, imposed a rejuvenating deep cleanse on Cairo. Roads once choked with honking cars ran free. The air, free of fumes, seemed to sparkle. Silence flooded the streets.At my apartment near the Nile, a bedroom that was barely usable because of the morning din became an oasis of calm. In the evenings, my family gathered on the balcony to witness sunsets that were more saturated than ever. The pollution app on my phone glowed an unfamiliar green.Of course, it came at a jarring price. On dawn runs down deserted streets, I passed anxious-looking people wearing masks, crowded around the entrance to a hospital.And then it was over.Toward the end of June, the government announced it was allowing mosques, restaurants and coffee houses to reopen.

A senior lawmaker warned that the crowded skies posed a threat to national security because Egypt\u2019s enemies could fit the kites with surveillance cameras.But on the bridge, nobody cared for such talk, preferring to wallow in this odd moment, between serenity and anxiety, when their city\u2019s famously frenetic pulse had been slowed by a virus.I chatted with two brothers who held aloft a giant kite emblazoned with photographs of themselves, preening, and the soccer star Mohamed Salah, who was beaming.

There is a fruit encased in prickly armor that smells of a deep, dank rot. There is a fruit that emits a sticky sap when peeled and another that stains fingernails mauve for those craving its succulent flesh.And there is the rambutan, which means \u201chairy thing\u201d in Malay. With its crimson skin studded with green feelers, the egg-sized fruit bears more than a passing resemblance to a coronavirus. It is yummy.ImageA seller showing the inside of a rambutan.With pandemic travel bans in place, Thailand\u2019s economic mainstay, tourism, has been battered. The country of 70 million has had to rely even more on exports of its agricultural products, and a national fruit lobby group predicts that overseas fruit shipments will increase by at least 10 percent this year, despite the coronavirus.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has called Thailand \u201cthe Great Power nation of fruit.\u201d Last year, the country ranked as the world\u2019s sixth biggest fruit exporter.But most of the fruit is exported to Thailand\u2019s regional neighbors, with China its biggest customer. The prospects of expanding to large Western markets like the United States may be appealing, but face some daunting obstacles.Less than 3 percent of Thailand\u2019s fruit was exported to the United States. Distance is one problem, as are worries about fruit flies accompanying the imports. But the main reason for the low figure may be that Southeast Asia\u2019s indigenous fruits have what Fuchsia Dunlop, a British author of Chinese cookbooks, calls a high \u201cgrapple factor.\u201dMany of the region\u2019s fruits require serious commitment to eat: laborious peeling, careful chewing and the frequent spitting out of seeds to which meat stubbornly adheres.To snack during office hours on a langsat, a demure cousin of a lychee with a peel that oozes a kind of natural super glue, is to submit to sticky fingers and sticky keyboards. Soap doesn\u2019t help.ImageLangsat and mangosteens on sale.The meat is perfumed but each bite is fraught, lest teeth accidentally penetrate the bitter seeds. The langsat is worth it, but only just.Unlike a banana\u2019s easy extraction, dissecting a jackfruit is to hack through a jagged sheath, then painstakingly pluck out rubbery polyps that taste like overripe Juicy Fruit gum.The process can consume an afternoon, and there are fruit vendors whose careers are dedicated to peeling jackfruit \u2014 a single specimen can weigh up to 120 pounds \u2014 and other complicated fruits.At Talad Thai, Bangkok\u2019s wholesale fruit market and the largest in Southeast Asia, there is an entire building dedicated to citrus and a gymnasium-sized section only for the mango, of which there are more than 200 varieties in Thailand.The fruits at Talad Thai are often transported and peeled by migrants from neighboring Cambodia or Myanmar.ImageUnloading durians.\u201cI was so poor that I had to look for work in Thailand,\u201d said Sing Dy, who was unloading a truck of fruit as sweat drenched her coronavirus face mask.She hasn\u2019t seen her children back in Cambodia for six months because of the pandemic travel ban, but she still sends most of her $20 a day salary back home.Each year, regional newspapers relate various jackfruit-related deaths, mostly involving someone lingering under a tree with fruit looming above. In May, a man in southern India was injured by a falling jackfruit and required spinal surgery, only to discover at the hospital that he also had the coronavirus. (He recovered.)In terms of showiness, the rambutan jousts with the dragon fruit, a neon pink mini-football covered in acid-green tendrils. To some, the experience of eating a dragon fruit, which grows on a cactus indigenous to South America, is a letdown after all that dazzling packaging: It\u2019s a bland mush with tiny seeds that can require floss to dislodge.ImageA dragon fruit sliced in half.Thais tend to approach milder fruit as a canvas for the fermented, spicy flavors that dominate the country\u2019s cuisine. So guavas, rose apples and pomelos, the world\u2019s largest citrus, are often served with a chili, salt and sugar dip to enliven the experience. Tart fruits, like green mangoes, are balanced with a sweet condiment that includes fish sauce, dried shrimp and shallots.If someone\u2019s fingernails are dyed purple at the tips, it likely betrays a preference for the mangosteen, a palm-sized orb that looks like an extra in a Super Mario Bros. video game. Beneath its woody rind are juicy segments that strike a Socratic equilibrium between sweet and sour.Even a peach has nothing on a mangosteen when it is perfect, but the mangosteen is rarely perfect. Many are afflicted with a blight that tarnishes the white flesh an ugly mustard hue. Which fruit is blemished is unknowable before peeling, and so to eat a pile of mangosteens is an exercise in disappointment.ImageTaking apart a mangosteen.The salak is also called the snakeskin fruit because its casing is undeniably reptilian. Inside is a not-quite-crunchy flesh that, like so many of Southeast Asia\u2019s native fruits, hovers between delectable and decayed. Some scientists have theorized the smell attracts rainforest primates, whose consumption and dispersal of the seeds helps the fruit take root for another generation.The most infamous fruit, which stinks of death, is the durian. Buildings and taxis in Thailand have no-durian signs next to no-smoking signs.The durian\u2019s flavor elicits passionate, and polarizing, responses, with few indifferent about the fruit\u2019s appeal or repulsiveness.On the outside, the durian resembles a medieval torture device. Nestled inside the spiky shell are kidney-shaped lobes of custard. The flavor is somewhere between an off-peak Gorgonzola and a cr\u00e8me caramel, with a whiff of skunk.ImageThick gloves help while handling sharp durian rinds.Orangutans adore the durian. In Indonesia, where expanding palm oil plantations have destroyed the apes\u2019 natural habitat, orangutans occasionally raid fruit orchards for sustenance. Farmers have responded by shooting them.Even if the smell could be put aside \u2014 which is, frankly, impossible \u2014 the durian would still probably have the highest grapple factor among Southeast Asia\u2019s endemic fruits. Thai exports of the fruit are mostly destined for China, where consumers tend to be more willing to work for their meals.The durian\u2019s greatest supporters hold out little hope that it will ever capture the United States market the way the kiwi charmed Americans in the 1970s, when marketers renamed the Chinese gooseberry after New Zealand\u2019s national bird. It helps that the kiwi, with its fuzzy peel, is cute and easy to eat.While some of Southeast Asia\u2019s indigenous fruits are available in specialty markets in the United States, the flavors lack the vibrancy of those grown at home, aficionados insist.Ubolwan Wongchotsathit is a second-generation fruit magnate, and she used to fly her durian as far away as Dubai and Melbourne before the pandemic forced her to use land and sea routes instead.\u201cAmericans say they hate the smell of durian,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.

Connecting their deaths to Colston was harder \u2014 not just because he is such a distant figure, but also because his name is inscribed on a concert hall across the street, a school nearby, a pub up the hill and housing for the poor next to it.\u201cHe\u2019s almost on the syllabus as the local hero,\u201d said Mr. Saunders, who is white, as Dylan went off to inspect a half-dozen black balloons fluttering in the wind where the statue had stood. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t excuse the evil of his original acts. It\u2019s like mugging a grandmother and giving half the money to charity.\u201dBristol is, for all intents and purposes, the town that Edward Colston built. Tearing down his statue has reopened a painful reckoning with the past \u2014 one that has long divided this port city of 460,000, laying bare its contradictions. It is multicultural but segregated, festive but given to spasms of unrest, liberal but enriched by the lucre of slavery.After the protesters toppled Colston, they dumped him in Bristol Harbor, a theatrical touch that recalled the rebellious British subjects in colonial Boston. But this protest was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, not the Boston Tea Party, and it poses a nettlesome challenge to Bristol, similar to that faced by cities across the American South, where statues of Confederate generals are teetering.ImageBristol Harbor, where the statue of Edward Colston was dumped, is a gateway to the Atlantic Ocean.Credit...James Beck for The New York TimesProtests have also broken out in London, Paris, Berlin and other European cities, drawing attention to police brutality, targeting monuments to Winston Churchill and King Leopold II of Belgium and igniting anguished debates about the difference between marking history and venerating its most oppressive actors.\u201cSome are elated about the statue coming down; some are confused; and some are very fearful and angry,\u201d the mayor, Marvin Rees, said in an interview. \u201cSome people are saying, \u2018Colston is Bristol, and therefore Colston is me. And if you take that statue down, you\u2019re taking something of me down.\u2019\u201dIt has put Mr. Rees, the son of a Jamaican father and a British mother, in a tricky position. As mayor, he said, he could not ignore criminal damage to public property. He also worried about crowds massing at a time when the coronavirus is still killing hundreds of people a day in Britain. But as a child of Jamaican immigrants, he said, \u201cI could not pretend I was anything but affronted by the statue.\u201d\u201cColston,\u201d he said, \u201cmay have owned one of my ancestors.\u201dMr. Rees ordered the statue fished out of the harbor and plans to install it in a museum, where it can be presented with historical context. There is no shortage of ideas for how to do that. Banksy, the mysterious street artist who became famous for his graffiti paintings on buildings in Bristol, posted a sketch on Instagram of a proposed memorial in which Colston would be shown in the act of being pulled down, with the protesters tugging on ropes around his neck.\u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting idea,\u201d Mr. Rees said, adding that the plan would need as much public consensus as possible.Finding that consensus will be elusive. For every visitor like Mr. Saunders, there is another like Nick Morris, a Bristol native who works for the National Health Service and considers the desecration of the statue an assault on his city\u2019s heritage.\u201cIf you pull down every statue around the world that has anything to do with slavery, abusing people, or war, there would be nothing left,\u201d said Mr. Morris, who is white. \u201cYou might as well pull down the pyramids.\u201dWhen Colston Hall, the city\u2019s majestic concert hall, announced in 2017 that it would change its name after a renovation, its managers faced threats from those who viewed the hall nostalgically as a place they went for school field trips.\u201cA lot of people thought we were trying to belittle their life experiences,\u201d said Louise Mitchell, the chief executive of Bristol Music Trust, which runs the hall.Still, Ms. Mitchell is plowing ahead with plans to unveil a new name by the fall. Colston Girls\u2019 School said it would begin a six-week consultation to consider changing its name. And the manager of the Colston Arms Pub, Paul Frost, said he would leave it to the public to decide whether to erase Colston.ImageThe manager of the Colston Arms Pub, Paul Frost, said the name Colston had become \u201ca toxic brand.\u201d\u00a0Credit...James Beck for The New York Times\u201cIt\u2019s a toxic brand,\u201d said Mr. Frost, who placed a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d sign out front to discourage would-be vandals.Whatever his reputation now, Edward Colston bequeathed Bristol the stately Georgian squares where its merchants once built their houses, and he helped preserve the churches that distinguish it today. As a director of the Royal African Company, which monopolized slave trading until 1698, he opened the business to the city. At its peak, in the mid-1700s, Bristol\u2019s merchants profited from a thriving triangular trade, exporting brassware and woolen cloth to the Guinea coast, now West Africa, where they bartered it for human cargo.After grim, dangerous voyages across the Atlantic, the slaves were sold to plantation owners in the British Caribbean, as well as Virginia. The ships returned to Bristol laden with sugar, rum and cocoa. Historians estimate that Colston\u2019s ships transported more than 84,000 slaves, of whom nearly 20,000 died during the crossings.It is impossible to escape the Colston name in Bristol. There is a street, an avenue and a parade named after him. He has a stained-glass window in Bristol Cathedral. There is even a local sweet bun, with dried currants, called the Colston bun.ImageColston\u2019s Almshouse on St. Michael\u2019s Hill near the center of Bristol.Credit...James Beck for The New York Times\u201cSome people still cling on to the saintly philanthropist idea,\u201d said Cleo Lake, who was the first black lord mayor of Bristol and removed a portrait of Colston from her office. While she said she hoped last week\u2019s events would finally change those shibboleths, she was troubled that the protesters, who pulled down the statue without interference from the police, were mostly white.\u201cWould it have been a different reaction if the people had been black?\u201d Ms. Lake asked. \u201cWould the prosecution have been tougher?\u201dOther black residents worry about a volley of charged language from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He condemned the \u201cthuggery\u201d of those who attack statues, saying it undermined lawful protests against racial injustice.The authorities in London covered up memorials of Churchill to protect them from vandals, while Oxford University faced calls to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes. Churchill\u2019s wartime heroics, critics say, should not paper over his history of racist statements. Rhodes\u2019s white supremacist views are considered by some to be a precursor to apartheid.In Bristol, there is already evidence of tit-for-tat desecration. Witnesses said a white man poured bleach on a statue of a Jamaican-born playwright, Alfred Fagon, which stands in a park in St. Paul\u2019s, the city\u2019s oldest black neighborhood. Among those who went to survey the damage, there was anger and sadness at what they said was a betrayal of the hard-won harmony of their diverse community.ImageA bust of the Jamaican-born playwright Alfred Fagon was reportedly vandalized after the toppling of the Colston statue.Credit...James Beck for The New York Times\u201cThis was revenge for Colston,\u201d said Lamoy Comrie, 37, who runs a Jamaican restaurant. \u201cBut if we are going to move on and put the past behind us and live in peace, then why does it have to be stuck in our faces?\u201dVanessa Kisuule, a black woman who is the resident poet of Bristol, said she feared the toppling of the statue would be \u201cswept up in a narrative of thuggery.\u201d But she allowed herself a moment of hope that this would be a transformative moment for her city, reconciling its sinister past and imperfect present with its idealized self-image: a tolerant, hip mecca for music, theater and art.To capture the moment, Ms. Kisuule wrote and posted a poem about the fall of Colston, which begins with these lines:You came down easy, in the end.The righteous wrench of two ropes in a grand pli\u00e9.Briefly, you flew.

The authorities have confirmed nearly two dozen of them in Morelos alone.When the police caught him that year, he could have faced more than 200 years in prison. But instead of prosecuting him, the authorities saw an opportunity, a chance to pick apart the cartel from the inside. They made him the centerpiece of an off-the-books police operation that dismantled the cartel in southern Morelos, resulting in the arrest and conviction of dozens of its operatives.For investigators, he was a gold mine, a complete reference book on the state\u2019s murder industry.

Within a few short years, she became one of the nation\u2019s most-wanted assassins.She preyed on the parish of Clarendon, carrying out nine confirmed kills, including a double homicide outside a bar, the killing of a father at a wake and the murder of a single mother of three. Her violence was indiscriminate: She shot and nearly killed a 14-year-old girl getting ready for church.With few clues to identify her, the police named her Briana. They knew only her country of origin \u2014 the United States \u2014 where she had been virtually untraceable since 1991. She was a phantom, the eighth-most-wanted killer on an island with no shortage of murder, suffering one of the highest homicide rates in the world. And she was only one of thousands.Briana, serial number 245PN70462, was a 9-millimeter Browning handgun.An outbreak of violence is afflicting Jamaica, born of small-time gangs, warring criminals and neighborhood feuds that go back generations \u2014 hand-me-down hatred fueled by pride. This year, the government called a state of emergency to stop the bloodshed in national hot spots, sending the military into the streets.Guns like Briana reside at the epicenter of the crisis. Worldwide, 32 percent of homicides are committed with firearms, according to the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a research group. In Jamaica, the figure is higher than 80 percent. And most of those guns come from the United States, amassed by exploiting loose American gun laws that facilitate the carnage.ImageThe funeral of Pauline Burke-Frazer, a victim of gun violence in Jamaica.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageThe burial of Ms. Burke-Frazer, who was killed with one of the many illegal guns on the street.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesWhile the gun control debate has flared in the United States for decades \u2014 most recently after the mass shootings this month in El Paso and Dayton \u2014 American firearms are pouring into neighboring countries and igniting record violence, in part because of federal and state restrictions that make it difficult, or sometimes nearly impossible, to track the weapons and interrupt smuggling networks.In the United States, the dispute over guns focuses almost exclusively on the policies, consequences and constitutional rights of American citizens, often framed by the assertion \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d \u2014 that the reckless acts of a few should not dictate access for all.But here in Jamaica, there is no such debate. Law enforcement officials, politicians and even gangsters on the street agree: It\u2019s the abundance of guns, typically from the United States, that makes the country so deadly. And while the argument over gun control plays on a continual loop in the United States, Jamaicans say they are dying because of it \u2014 at a rate that is nine times the global average.\u201cMany people in the U.S. see gun control as a purely domestic issue,\u201d said Anthony Clayton, the lead author of Jamaica\u2019s 2014 National Security Policy. But America\u2019s \u201clong-suffering neighbors, whose citizens are being murdered by U.S. weapons, have a very different perspective.\u201dFirearms play such a central role in Jamaican murders that the authorities keep a list of the nation\u2019s 30 deadliest guns, based on ballistic matches. To keep track of them, they are given names, like Ghost or Ambrogio.Some, like Briana, are so poorly documented that the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has nothing more than a piece of paper with the name and details of the original buyer, according to confidential documents reviewed by The New York Times.Purchased in 1991 by a farmer in Greenville, N.C., the Browning vanished from the public record for nearly 24 years \u2014 until it suddenly started wreaking havoc in Jamaica. For three years, its ballistic fingerprint connected it to shootings, mystifying law enforcement. Finally, after a firefight with the police, it was recovered last year and its bloody run came to an end.The authorities traced the serial number back to the handgun\u2019s original owner. But that did not explain how the weapon wound up in Jamaica decades later. Or how the authorities could prevent the next Briana from arriving.The mystery is no accident. By law, licensed gun merchants in the United States are not required to do much more than record retail sales, and usually don\u2019t have to report them to the authorities. After that, if a gun is stolen, lost or handed to someone else, paperwork is only sometimes required.Only a few American states mandate the registration of some or all firearms. Several other states explicitly prohibit it. And there is no national, comprehensive registry of gun ownership. The federal government is forbidden to create one.Drawing on court documents, case files, dozens of interviews and confidential data from law enforcement officials in both countries, The Times traced a single gun \u2014 Briana \u2014 to nine different homicides in Clarendon, a largely rural area of Jamaica where violence has spiked in recent years.It is just one of the hundreds of thousands of guns that leak out of the United States and overwhelm countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 100,000 people are killed every year across the region \u2014 most of them by firearms.\u201cI still love him and miss him all the time,\u201d said Clovis Cooke Sr., weeping over the murder of his son, Clovis Jr., who was gunned down in 2017 with the Browning the authorities call Briana.\u201cHe took care of me,\u201d Mr. Cooke said of his son. \u201cEvery week he would come by and bring food and groceries and pay the bills.\u201dJamaica brims with losses like his. American weapons are routinely funneled into the country aboard ships, flooding cities like Kingston, the capital, where high-grade assault rifles are wielded by warring gangs.ImageA gang member holding a Kalashnikov rifle at a house in Kingston, Jamaica.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageThe police raiding a house in Kingston while looking for a gang member.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesJamaica\u2019s own gun laws are relatively strict, with fewer than 45,000 legal firearms in a country of almost three million.But it is awash in illegal weapons. The Jamaican authorities, who estimate that 200 guns are smuggled into the country from the United States every month, routinely ask American officials to examine some of the weapons they seize in raids, during traffic stops or at the ports.Of the nearly 1,500 weapons the A.T.F. checked from 2016 through 2018, 71 percent came from the United States.The figures are similar in Mexico, which has been lobbying the United States for more than a decade to stop the illegal guns flowing south. By some estimates, more than 200,000 guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, many to feed the vast criminal networks fighting over the multibillion-dollar drug trade to the United States.But here in Jamaica, the killings are rarely driven by such enormous profits. The drug trade has fallen from its heyday, organized crime has been fractured and most of the historic kingpins have been killed or imprisoned.Instead, the guns in Jamaica are often used in petty feuds, neighborhood beefs and turf wars that go back decades, to when political parties authored the majority of the country\u2019s violence.Because guns are so plentiful, small insults and old vendettas that might otherwise leave few casualties grow much more dangerous \u2014 not just for the combatants, but also for anyone who happens to be in the way.\u201cA lot of violence is the result of people settling their disputes, and with all the guns in the country, it is easy to settle things that way,\u201d said Orlando Patterson, a Jamaican-born sociology professor at Harvard University. \u201cThat is where it\u2019s at right now. The early factors, the politics, international drugs, they are gone.\u201dEven some of the gang members agree they are often fighting over small stakes \u2014 and sometimes no financial stakes at all.\u201cI mean, with or without the guns, we will still fight,\u201d said one gang leader in Kingston, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. \u201cBut the guns make it deadlier. There would be a big difference without as many guns.\u201dFrom North Carolina Into Thin AirJohnnie Ray Dunn walked into a North Carolina gun store in the fall of 1991 and purchased an American icon: a 9-millimeter Browning.With its all-steel frame, the gun was built to weather abuse, with a reputation for accuracy and functionality.Mr. Dunn, a farmer, handed over his details and went home with a gun that, if maintained, would last a lifetime.That\u2019s where Briana\u2019s paper trail began \u2014 and ended.President Ronald Reagan had signed a bill that prohibited the creation of any sweeping national gun registry \ufffc\ufffcfive years earlier, a pivotal piece of legislation in the history of American gun law.The National Rifle Association lobbied heavily for the bill, which many saw as a way of expanding gun sales by ensuring easy access to firearms. Underpinning the effort was a warning that still resonates with many of the law\u2019s supporters today: that a national registry would enable the United States government to keep track of gun owners and crack down on their right to bear arms.\u201cIt will be used to take away our guns,\u201d said John Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, explaining one of the main talking points against a national registry.The law effectively ruled out a federal system of tracking all firearms. So when Mr. Dunn\u2019s gun suddenly showed up in Jamaica, linked to a series of homicides from 2015 through early 2018, no one could figure out how it got there.The A.T.F. was unable to trace the gun beyond its initial purchase, and Mr. Dunn would not have been required to report if it had been sold, swapped, lost or stolen. The weapon disappeared into what some experts call the black hole of American gun laws.Mr. Dunn died in 2011, according to a local newspaper obituary, and is not considered a suspect in the gun\u2019s path to Jamaica. The Times attempted to reach his family, without success.Guns like his regularly torment Jamaican officials. Most firearms used in crimes are orphans of a system that seems geared to forget them. Purchased legally, they eventually fall into the vast ocean of what the A.T.F. estimates to be more than 300 million guns circulating in the United States, their chain of ownership often irrevocably broken.\u201cThis is the stereotypical crime gun,\u201d said Joseph Blocher, a professor at Duke University School of Law. \u201cThey almost all originate with a legal sale and are then passed on, stolen or otherwise vanish before reappearing in a crime.\u201dBecause Jamaican officials cannot tell how handguns like the 9-millimeter Browning entered their country \u2014 even with the assistance of American law enforcement \u2014 they struggle to shut down the smuggling rings that fuel the nation\u2019s violence.ImageAmerican weapons are routinely funneled into the country, often by container, flooding cities like Kingston.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAll they know is that, more than 20 years after being sold in North Carolina, the handgun became one of the most lethal in Jamaica, the tool of a one-eyed gangster named Hawk Eye.Samuda Daley got the nickname as a boy. He saw poorly out of one eye, and after an unsuccessful surgery left it covered in a milky film, his alias was born.Mr. Daley was a product of violence, shaped by its near constant presence in his life. As a child, a relative said, his mother was stabbed to death by his uncle.By ninth grade, he had dropped out of school to start working at a sugar factory, telling his family he didn\u2019t want to rely on anyone. He joined the Gaza gang, a clique of young men who had grown up together in a knotted cluster of streets in Clarendon.They began by hanging out, not fighting, his family said. But in the crucible of poverty and desperation, where small conflicts can turn deadly, they ran afoul of a similar group, the King Street gang. The rivalry grew quickly.On Sept. 19, 2015, almost exactly 24 years after Mr. Dunn purchased the gun, the first sign that it had made its way to Jamaica appeared: A man named Okeeve Martin was killed with an unknown 9-millimeter Browning.There was no money or territory at stake, residents say. The motive seemed to be revenge \u2014 the girlfriend of the Gaza gang\u2019s leader had been shot by mistake in an earlier episode.She survived, but the rumor mill led to Mr. Martin, and retribution came swiftly.The gun lay dormant for a year before claiming the life of a 17-year-old, Shane Sewell, on Sept. 6, 2016. He was walking home, having left a bar after a night with friends. He ended up in a ditch, riddled with bullets, some from the mysterious Browning.Officials believe he was killed in a dispute over a different firearm. In Jamaica, guns are often rented out by their owners, as a hardware store might rent out valuable tools. The borrower, looking to commit a robbery or even kill someone, pays a fee to use the weapon. Afterward, the gun is returned. Given a gun\u2019s income potential, when one is lost or stolen, the consequences can be deadly.In the summer of 2017, the Browning struck again. Kurt Mitchell, a fisherman believed to be a member of the King Street gang, was gunned down at a party \u2014 a reprisal for an earlier homicide against the Gaza gang, the authorities believe.His death, in turn, generated still more deaths, in the tragic rhythm that violence often takes in Jamaica.Much of the fighting today stems from political conflicts that stretch back long before the shooters were born. In past decades, armed groups loyal to one of the two major parties \u2014 the Jamaica Labour Party and the People\u2019s National Party \u2014 battled one another for dominance.The patronage networks eventually transitioned to crime, stripped of their political focus. Local leaders, known as Dons, grew incredibly powerful, as deep connections to the United States, Canada and Britain enabled their criminal enterprises to become transnational.But that, too, changed as the government cracked down on the Dons and targeted the drug trade in Jamaica. By 2010, the Dons were all but a thing of the past, with the last major player, Christopher Coke, known locally as Dudus, arrested and extradited to the United States after battles that resulted in the deaths of at least 73 people.\u201c2010 was a watershed moment,\u201d said Damian Hutchinson, the executive director of the Peace Management Initiative, which works to stop violence in Jamaica\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods. \u201cThe Don culture started to change. The political enforcers were now undermined by younger, less conscientious individuals with less purpose to the violence.\u201dImageThe police conducting raids in high-crime areas of downtown Kingston.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageResidents watched during a raid as the police looked for a gang member wanted in connection with weapons charges.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe splintered factions began fighting one another, leading to more \u2014 and more random \u2014 violence. Wars broke out between once-aligned blocks and the gangs multiplied, to more than 250 nationwide today.Those armed factions, fighting a small-scale war, have lifted homicides to new peaks.The 9-millimeter Browning became a terrifying facet of this landscape, with evidence tying it to more than eight homicide scenes.As officials tried to stitch together the clues, the gun was repeatedly being used as an enforcement tool of the Gaza gang, often by Mr. Daley, the killer known as Hawk Eye.He was quiet, never bragging about his exploits, residents and family members said. He didn\u2019t need to. His ruthlessness was well known, and neighbors afforded him a grudging respect.Mr. Daley had become embroiled in a personal feud with another gangster, Christopher Lynch, and some of the shootings that plagued Clarendon in 2017 came from their hatred for each other, officials say.They had once been close friends, almost like family, relatives said, but that former intimacy now burned with an equally intense hostility. Mr. Daley tried to kill him on a Sunday in 2017, when he spotted him walking home from a soccer game.He fired at Mr. Lynch, who took off running through the woods and escaped, officials say. But a stray bullet struck a 14-year-old girl in the stomach as she prepared for church. Luckily, the girl survived.Months later, Mr. Lynch\u2019s father was at a wake, a late-night affair with drinks and music, a celebration of life common in parts of Jamaica. At around 10:30 p.m., investigators now believe, Mr. Daley stormed the wake and began shooting. The elder Lynch died. Three others were injured.Once again, the bullet fragments connected the shootings to the 9 millimeter.From Idaho to Montego BayNot all guns vanish without a trace and suddenly reappear, decades later. Some are bought openly and sent overseas right away.From late 2016 through early 2017, a 74-year-old man from Idaho purchased three military-style rifles and a Glock .45 pistol in Meridian, Idaho, a town of about 100,000 people surrounded by more than two dozen gun stores.Six months later, all four guns were recovered by the Jamaican authorities in a raid in the Montego Bay area, where criminal violence has overwhelmed the parish of St. James.The area is a notable exception to Jamaica\u2019s vendetta violence. A multimillion-dollar scamming industry has flourished there, inciting so many homicides that the government sent in the military.ImageA cemetery in Kingston where numerous gang members have been buried.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageThe police patrolling in downtown Kingston. The Jamaican authorities have struggled to trace weapons, including many bought legally in the United States.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe scammers \u2014 who swindle American citizens into sending money or divulging their bank account information \u2014 are well financed and capable of building armories to battle their competitors.The weapons, like other illicit arms in Jamaica, arrive in containers aboard the hundreds of ships that come to the island each month. Often, they slip through in small batches, broken down into parts and hidden in freezers or car engines to evade inspectors.Of course, not all illegal guns in Latin America and the Caribbean come from the United States. In some countries, including those with weapons left over from civil wars, fewer than half of the illicit weapons trace back to American soil.But firearms trafficking from the United States is such a big problem that the A.T.F. says it is dedicated to fighting it. Commercial traffic between the United States and Jamaica has become more closely surveilled in recent years, so smugglers have started bringing in the guns through Haiti, too, often in exchange for marijuana or even meat.Criminal networks, like those in the scamming industry, also turn to straw buyers in the United States \u2014 people who purchase the guns legally and send them to Jamaica, either complicit, misled or uninterested in how they are used.The Idaho man may have been a victim of the scammers himself. Officials say the swindlers appear to have pressured him into buying the weapons, promising to return his pilfered savings.It was the Glock .45 that caught the attention of American and Jamaican authorities. Only three months after the Idaho man purchased it, the gun was already in Jamaica \u2014 and had killed Jeffrey Cato, a 39-year-old mentally ill man, on March 17, 2017.Mr. Cato, a beloved figure in the community of Flankers, had no obvious enemies. He seemed to float in his own space, neighbors said, harmless and uninvolved.On the day of his death, Mr. Cato was getting food for one of his children. The police never identified a motive, but believe he may have witnessed a murder.\u201cHe had no gang connections whatsoever,\u201d said one detective, speaking anonymously because the investigation was still open. \u201cIn my eight years working, there\u2019s only a few cases that still stick with me. This is one of them.\u201dLast July, the gun was used again, to kill Nicholas Kerr, a quiet 41-year-old who lived in the basement of his mother\u2019s home. He was shot at a corner store, buying a soda.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had enemies here,\u201d said Mr. Kerr\u2019s mother, withholding her name for fear of retribution. \u201cBut Nicholas?\u201d she added. \u201cHe was peaceful.\u201d\u2018Every Day They Kill People\u2019Joviane Hall was D.J.-ing at a local bar near Clarendon at 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 6, 2017, when gunmen burst in without warning.After robbing the bar and its patrons, they opened fire, hitting Mr. Hall, who died on the way to the hospital. Officials recognized the culprit, a weapon they had come to loathe: the Browning.The murder was the beginning of a spree. Two days later, another shooting occurred at the Three Sisters Bar. At around 10:50 p.m., two friends, Clovis Cooke and Otis Gordon, were standing outside, drinking, when a car pulled up.The shooter fired 21 shots and sped off. Investigators found yet another set of 9-millimeter fragments.Every murder committed, every life taken, left a wound that never healed. Ten minutes from the Three Sisters Bar, which is now dormant and overgrown with dense foliage, Mr. Cooke\u2019s parents live in their simple, vinyl-sided home off the side of the highway.His father, recovering from cataract surgery, plodded around in the dark, searching for overdue bills in the drift of papers on the small dining table.Image\u201cI still love him and miss him all the time,\u201d said Clovis Cooke Sr., as he recounted the murder of his son, Clovis Jr., who was gunned down in 2017 with the 9-millimeter Browning the authorities call Briana.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesHe wept at the mention of his son, 33, who used to pay the bills and help out around the house. Married at 15, his parents grew up raising him. But time had inverted their roles, and now, without him, they were nearly destitute.\u201cI think about him everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day they kill people,\u201d he said, \u201cand every day we grieve about it.\u201dThe same void haunted the home where Jody Ann Harvey was killed less than two months after Mr. Cooke, in what some believe was a case of mistaken identity.Gunmen charged into her one-room shack, kicking open the door and firing on Ms. Harvey and her daughter as they slept in the small bed they shared. Ms. Harvey covered the girl with her body, taking six 9-millimeter rounds in the hail of gunfire. Her daughter survived.Last spring, the home still sat abandoned in a thicket of trees, its wooden stairwell rotting, its blue and green paint blistered. Ashley Wilson, Ms. Harvey\u2019s sister, had come by \u2014 to visit, to fill the single room with memories. To mourn.\u201cI just miss her, I guess,\u201d she said, swinging the rickety door open. \u201cI go inside, into her room, where it happened. It brings back a lot of memories. I\u2019ll look at pictures of her, listen to music we liked, talk to her daughter. This is how it goes.\u201dThe deadly run of the Browning ended, in some ways, the way it began.Joy Commock, the girlfriend of the Gaza gang\u2019s leader \u2014 the person who had been shot by mistake and survived, starting the cycle of revenge that first set the handgun loose on Jamaica \u2014 was killed on Jan. 21, 2018.The casings matched the earlier crimes: The gun killed Ms. Commock as well, officials say.She was home alone with her daughter when she heard a noise, the police say. It was just after midnight and the smell of smoke filled the air.She raced outside and found a fire burning in her front yard. She knelt to extinguish the flames, and was shot multiple times by an assailant hiding in the shadows.Her daughter, one of three, hid inside. When the girl emerged, her mother was dead, lying face down in the yard.\u201cShe was the sole breadwinner,\u201d said Ms. Commock\u2019s sister, Lotoya Evans. \u201cThey were her life.\u201d\u201cThey expect you to forget about it, but when you lose somebody, you don\u2019t just get up and act normal,\u201d she added, holding her own daughter tight.By early 2018, the authorities were still no closer to finding the gun. They knew its caliber, and even the conflict the gun was caught in. But while Mr. Daley, the enforcer known as Hawk Eye, was still alive, no witnesses dared to testify.At around 11 p.m. on April 28, an off-duty policeman was having a drink at a local bar in Clarendon when two men showed up to rob it. One of them was Mr. Daley, who flashed the Browning at patrons and demanded money. The officer drew on the two men and announced himself, officials say.Mr. Daley turned and fired, but the policeman had the drop on both men, killing Mr. Daley on the spot.And like that, the gun was off the streets.Witnesses came forward to link Mr. Daley to other shootings, officials say, and the police later asked the A.T.F. to run a trace on his weapon.It led all the way to North Carolina, to a time before Mr. Daley was even born.ImageA street in Kingston.

The U.S. Wants to Keep Them Out. ", "summary": "", "authors": "By Azam Ahmed", "text": "JALAPA, Guatemala \u2014 They climbed the terraced hillside in single file, their machetes tapping the stones along the darkened footpath.Gehovany Ramirez, 17, led his brother and another accomplice to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home. He struck the wooden door with his machete, sending splinters into the air.His girlfriend, Lubia Sasvin P\u00e9rez, had left him a month earlier, fleeing his violent temper for her parents\u2019 home here in southeast Guatemala. Five months pregnant, her belly hanging from her tiny 16-year-old frame, she feared losing the child to his rage.Lubia and her mother slipped outside and begged him to leave, she said. They could smell the sour tang of alcohol on his breath. Unmoved, he raised the blade and struck her mother in the head, killing her.Hearing a stifled scream, her father rushed outside. Lubia recalled watching in horror as the other men set upon him, splitting his face and leaving her parents splayed on the concrete floor. For prosecutors, judges and even defense lawyers in Guatemala, the case exemplifies the national scourge of domestic violence, motivated by a deep-seated sense of ownership over women and their place in relationships.But instead of facing the harsher penalties meant to stop such crimes in Guatemala, Gehovany received only four years in prison, a short sentence even by the country\u2019s lenient standard for minors. More than three years later, now 21, he will be released next spring, perhaps sooner.And far from being kept from the family he tore apart, under Guatemalan law Gehovany has the right to visit his son upon release, according to legal officials in Guatemala.The prospect of his return shook the family so thoroughly that Lubia\u2019s father, who survived the attack, sold their home and used the money to pay a smuggler to reach the United States. Now living outside of San Francisco, he is pinning his hopes on winning asylum to safeguard his family. They all are.But that seems more distant than ever. Two extraordinary legal decisions by the Trump administration have struck at the core of asylum claims rooted in domestic violence or threats against families like Lubia\u2019s \u2014 not only casting doubt on their case, but almost certainly on thousands of others as well, immigration lawyers say.\u201cHow can this be justice?\u201d Lubia said before the family fled, sitting under the portico where her mother was killed. \u201cAll I did was leave him for beating me and he took my mother from us.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of system protects him, and not me?\u201d she said, gathering her son in her lap.ImageLubia is hoping for asylum in the United States, but her case faces significant obstacles under the Trump administration.Credit...Meridith Kohut for The New York TimesTheir case offers a glimpse into the staggering number of Central Americans fleeing violence and dysfunction \u2014 and the dogged fight the Trump administration is waging to keep them out.Across Latin America, a murder epidemic is underway. Most years, more than 100,000 people are killed, largely young men on the periphery of broken societies, where gangs and cartels sometimes take the place of the state.The turmoil has forced millions to flee the region and seek refuge in the United States, where they confront a system strained by record demand and a bitter fight over whether to accept them.But violence against women, and domestic violence in particular, is a powerful and often overlooked factor in the migration crisis. Latin America and the Caribbean are home to 14 of the 25 deadliest nations in the world for women, according to available data collected by the Small Arms Survey, which tracks violence globally.And Central America, the region where most of those seeking asylum in the United States are fleeing, is at the heart of the crisis.Here in Guatemala, the homicide rate for women is more than three times the global average. In El Salvador, it is nearly six times. In Honduras, it is one of the highest in the world \u2014 almost 12 times the global average.ImageFriends and family mourning during the funeral procession for Cristina Yulisa God\u00ednez, 18, in Guatemala City.

Lawyers have sometimes pushed successfully for women to qualify as a social group because of the overwhelming violence they face, citing a 2014 case in which a Guatemalan woman fleeing domestic violence was found to be eligible to apply for asylum in the United States.But Mr. Sessions overruled that precedent, questioning whether women \u2014 in particular, women fleeing domestic violence \u2014 can be members of a social group. The decision challenged what had become common practice in asylum courts.Then, last month, the new attorney general, William P. Barr, went further. Breaking with decades of precedent, he issued a decision making it harder for families, like Lubia\u2019s, to qualify as social groups also.Violence against women in the region is so prevalent that 18 countries have passed laws to protect them, creating a class of homicide known as femicide, which adds tougher penalties and greater law enforcement attention to the issue.And yet, despite that broad effort, the new laws have failed to reduce the killings of girls and women in the region, the United Nations says.That reflects how deep the gender gap runs. For the new laws to make a difference, experts say, they must go far beyond punishment to change education, political discourse, social norms and basic family dynamics.Though gangs and cartels in the region play a role in the violence, most women are killed by lovers, family members, husbands or partners \u2014 men angered by women acting independently, enraged by jealousy or, like Gehovany, driven by a deeply ingrained sense of control over women\u2019s lives.\u201cMen end up thinking they can dispose of women as they wish,\u201d said Adriana Qui\u00f1ones, the United Nations Women\u2019s country representative in Guatemala.A vast majority of female homicides in the region are never solved. In Guatemala, only about 6 percent result in convictions, researchers say. And in the rare occasions when they do, as in Lubia\u2019s case, they are not always prosecuted vigorously.Even defense attorneys believe Gehovany should have been charged with femicide, which would have put him in prison a couple of years longer. The fact that he was not, some Guatemalan officials acknowledge, underscores the many ways in which the nation\u2019s legal system, even when set up to protect women, continues to fail them.In the courtroom, Lubia\u2019s father, Romeo de Jesus Sasvin Dominguez, spoke up just once.It didn\u2019t make sense, he told the judge, shaking his head. A long white scar ran over the bridge of his nose, a relic of the attack. How could the laws of Guatemala favor the man who killed his wife, who hurt his daughter?\u201cWe had a life together,\u201d he told the judge, nearly in tears. \u201cAnd he came and took that away from us just because my daughter didn\u2019t want to be in an abusive relationship.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.ImageThough Jalapa has a lower homicide rate than other areas of Guatemala, the region is still very dangerous for women.Credit...Meridith Kohut for The New York Times\u2018It\u2019s like our"}, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/fauci-trump-coronavirus.html", "title": "Trump Aides Undercut Fauci as He Speaks Up on Virus Concerns", "summary": "Administration officials moved to treat the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert as if he were a warring political rival, releasing a list of what they said were questionable statements he had made.", "authors": "By Maggie Haberman", "text": "President Trump\u2019s advisers undercut the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S.

It has been accompanied by more measured public criticism from administration officials, including the president.And it came just days after the White House called school reopening guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overly restrictive, part of a pattern of the administration trying to sideline recommendations that could slow the reopening of the economy, which Mr. Trump views as vital to his flailing re-election effort.Aides to Mr. Trump first released to The Washington Post what the paper called a \u201clengthy list\u201d of remarks that Dr. Fauci had made about the virus when it was in its early stages.

Like many residents of rural Oregon, Mr. Garcia is bracing for a spike in coronavirus cases that feels all but inevitable as local farms and food processing facilities transition into harvest season.Oregon, once one of the most successful states in managing the pandemic, is now undergoing a viral surge in rural areas.

But unlike two of its neighboring states, Washington and California, Oregon was not quickly overwhelmed by the pandemic. The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, far fewer than most of its neighbors. But as the state reopens after an early lockdown, cases are spiking. The state set a grim record on Thursday with 389 new infections.If the spread of the virus continues at its current rate, Oregon Health Authority models predict that Portland hospitals will hit capacity in a month, and hospitals throughout the state will be overwhelmed within 90 days.\u201cWe\u2019re sandwiched between California and Washington,\u201d Gov. Kate Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re not an island, and the virus knows absolutely no jurisdictional boundaries.\u201dThe increase has been most drastic in rural parts of the state where outbreaks have been spurred on by large gatherings at churches, food-processing facilities, funerals and graduation parties.Ms. Brown ordered Oregonians to wear masks in public buildings, starting July 1. She also introduced a spending package to fund protective equipment and quarantine pay for farm workers.And on Monday, Ms. Brown said she was issuing a statewide ban on indoor social gatherings of more than 10 people, saying the state needed to crack down on social events that were spreading the virus. The ban would limit things such as birthday parties and book clubs, but it would not apply to businesses or churches \u201cat this time,\u201d she said.Oregon public health officials expect that recent Fourth of July festivities will soon produce new cases, as happened after Memorial Day gatherings.

And they have been forced onto the national and global stage in a way few governors have ever endured \u2014 an unending and very public test on a highly scientific and ever-shifting subject with the lives of their constituents, the economies of their states and their political careers at stake.Tate Reeves has been the governor of Mississippi for just under six months. During that time, he has had a very full plate: deadly tornadoes, the flooding of the capital city of Jackson, violence in the state prisons, a vote to take down the flag with the Confederate battle emblem.But the coronavirus has eclipsed all of that, and in recent days, the virus was threatening the statehouse and his own house a few blocks away.Mr. Reeves, 46, was tested for the virus, as were his wife and three daughters.

And it is a new red mark on the nation\u2019s floundering efforts to combat the virus.\u201cIt has just been horrifically busy,\u201d John Toney, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of South Florida, said of hospitals where patients were flooding in and doctors and nurses were growing overwhelmed and exhausted.\u201cIt\u2019s reminiscent of what everyone dealt with in New York,\u201d Professor Toney said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly putting a strain on a lot of the systems, even though hospitals are trying to accommodate.\u201dThe increase of 15,300 cases has come as Disney World has let tourists back onto its rides, the Republican National Convention is set to begin in Jacksonville in August, and Gov.

Now some states are trying to add mask mandates and other protective measures, and seeing renewed tensions between governors and mayors as they disagree over how much to pull back on the reopening.In some ways, the situation in Florida differs from the worst days of the pandemic in New York.Some of the increase in cases reflects the dramatic increase in testing; Florida is testing several times the number of people that New York was at the height of its crisis. The spread of the disease amid the Florida sun does not play out with the same dread as it did in crowded city streets in New York. Hospitals are better supplied and somewhat more prepared to treat patients than they were in March and April.

The mask was made of a single, neatly folded paper towel with a rubber band stapled to each end.\u201cWhen I saw this, I kind of cried,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.In an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Mr. Garcia, an addiction counselor, spends his days off volunteering to deliver masks from the local health department to field workers. Like many residents of rural Oregon, Mr. Garcia is bracing for a spike in coronavirus cases that feels all but inevitable as local farms and food processing facilities transition into harvest season.Oregon, once one of the most successful states in managing the pandemic, is now undergoing a viral surge in rural areas. Agricultural areas like Umatilla County, where Mr. Garcia lives and works, now have some of the highest rates of cases in Oregon.\u201cI know it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d Mr. Garcia said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re on our own.\u201dThe coronavirus struck Oregon early, with cases emerging in February. But unlike two of its neighboring states, Washington and California, Oregon was not quickly overwhelmed by the pandemic. The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, far fewer than most of its neighbors. But as the state reopens after an early lockdown, cases are spiking. The state set a grim record on Thursday with 389 new infections.If the spread of the virus continues at its current rate, Oregon Health Authority models predict that Portland hospitals will hit capacity in a month, and hospitals throughout the state will be overwhelmed within 90 days.\u201cWe\u2019re sandwiched between California and Washington,\u201d Gov. Kate Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re not an island, and the virus knows absolutely no jurisdictional boundaries.\u201dThe increase has been most drastic in rural parts of the state where outbreaks have been spurred on by large gatherings at churches, food-processing facilities, funerals and graduation parties.Ms. Brown ordered Oregonians to wear masks in public buildings, starting July 1. She also introduced a spending package to fund protective equipment and quarantine pay for farm workers.And on Monday, Ms. Brown said she was issuing a statewide ban on indoor social gatherings of more than 10 people, saying the state needed to crack down on social events that were spreading the virus. The ban would limit things such as birthday parties and book clubs, but it would not apply to businesses or churches \u201cat this time,\u201d she said.Oregon public health officials expect that recent Fourth of July festivities will soon produce new cases, as happened after Memorial Day gatherings. But despite contact-tracing efforts, public health officials are encountering more and more people who are not able to determine how they were infected with the virus, a worrying indication of community spread."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/arizona-coronavirus-mark-anthony-urquiza.html", "title": "Daughter\u2019s Obituary Blames Politicians for Arizona Man\u2019s Virus Death", "summary": "Kristin Urquiza, writing about her father\u2019s death, pointed the finger at how state and federal leaders have handled the coronavirus pandemic.", "authors": "By Aimee Ortiz", "text": "When Kristin Urquiza\u2019s father died last month in Arizona, she wrote an obituary that offered not one but two causes of death: the coronavirus, and ineptitude on the part of government officials.Mark Anthony Urquiza, \u201clike so many others, should not have died,\u201d Ms. Urquiza wrote in an impassioned obituary published in The Arizona Republic.\u201cHis death,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis due to the carelessness of the politicians who continue to jeopardize the health of brown bodies through a clear lack of leadership, refusal to acknowledge the severity of this crisis, and inability and unwillingness to give clear and decisive direction on how to minimize risk.\u201dIn many respects, the article Ms. Urquiza wrote about her father, who died June 30 at age 65, was an ordinary obituary.

Most polls in Alabama close at 8 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.Texas also has primary runoffs on Tuesday for several key House seats, as well as a Democratic Senate primary runoff between M.J.

It\u2019s Monday, and this is your politics tip sheet. ImageWhere things standSome high-profile Republicans \u2014 as well as just about every Democrat with a microphone \u2014 are crying foul after President Trump announced on Friday that he was commuting the sentence of Roger Stone, his old friend and former adviser. Stone, who was convicted of seven felonies \u2014 including perjury and obstruction of justice \u2014 had been sentenced to 40 months in prison.Trump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence just days before he was to report to prison, in spite of warnings from White House advisers that doing so \u201cwould be politically self-destructive if not ethically inappropriate,\u201d as Peter Baker writes in an analysis.Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, has shied away from publicly criticizing Trump, but on Saturday he published an op-ed article in The Washington Post defending the work of his office, and the eight guilty pleas or convictions at trial \u2014 including Stone\u2019s \u2014 that it secured.\u201cThe Russia investigation was of paramount importance,\u201d Mueller writes. \u201cStone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.\u201d Later, Mueller insists: \u201cThe women and men who conducted these investigations and prosecutions acted with the highest integrity. Claims to the contrary are false.\u201dCharacteristically, Mueller does not question the president directly in the op-ed. Instead, he seems to mostly be addressing Trump\u2019s supporters and anyone else who disputes the legitimacy of the Russia investigation.This invites one question \u2014 Why try to do this in the pages of The Washington Post, hardly a trusted publication among Trump fans? \u2014 while declining to address another: As special counsel, a lengthy feature in the current issue of The New Yorker asks, why didn\u2019t Mueller push harder to equip Congress with the tools to remove Trump from office?Senator Lindsey Graham, a fierce defender of Trump, said yesterday that he would call Mueller to testify before the Judiciary Committee, signaling he would keep trying to discredit the Russia investigation.At least two Republican senators, Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, criticized Trump\u2019s decision to free Stone. \u201cUnprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,\u201d Romney wrote on Twitter on Saturday.Toomey, who is typically an ally of the president, was more measured. \u201cWhile I understand the frustration with the badly flawed Russia-collusion investigation, in my view, commuting Roger Stone\u2019s sentence is a mistake,\u201d Toomey said in a statement.Trump shot back in an angry tweet late Saturday, calling both senators \u201cRINO\u2019s,\u201d or Republicans In Name Only.The number of new daily coronavirus cases in the United States topped 60,000 for the first time on Friday. Recorded cases are now on the rise in 37 states, prompting many state governments to re-evaluate plans to reopen their economies.Florida announced 15,000 new cases of the virus yesterday, the highest single-day total of known infections for any state thus far. The number of cases among members of the U.S. military has more than doubled in the past month. The country is now averaging roughly 700 deaths from the virus each day, from less than 500 earlier this month \u2014 but still far lower than the mid-April average of more than 2,200.Trump, yielding to months of pressure from advisers and the advice of his own public health team, wore a face mask in public for the first time during a visit on Saturday to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a hospital, especially,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing to wear a mask.\u201dIn an interview yesterday with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, said the widespread use of masks would be essential to stemming the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cIn order for us to reverse this problem, we need about 90 percent of people in those really hot areas to wear masks when they\u2019re in public,\u201d Giroir said. He declined to say whether he thought the federal government should make mask-wearing mandatory nationwide.A number of major corporations announced heavy layoffs last week, in the early rumblings of what economists say may be the start of a new phase in the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout.After unemployment skyrocketed at the start of the outbreak, things briefly seemed as though they might stabilize. But now, with economic activity looking uncertain for the duration of the year and consumer confidence remaining low, companies are making longer-term adjustments and cutting more workers loose.Congress is stuck in a holding pattern on further virus relief legislation, as Republicans in the Senate have refused to take up the $3 trillion relief bill that House Democrats passed in May.But another round of stimulus legislation appears inevitable, and on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d yesterday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to draw a red line: She said it was essential that Congress extend the $600-a-week expansion to unemployment benefits that is set to expire at the end of this month. \u201cWe must extend the unemployment insurance,\u201d Pelosi told Dana Bash. \u201cPeople are desperately in need.\u201dIn an interview with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, echoed Trump\u2019s declaration from last week that schools must reopen in the fall, even as virus infections surge. She repeated the president\u2019s threat that districts could lose federal funding if they refused to comply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous,\u201d she said.But in a confidential government report circulated around the White House this month and obtained by The New York Times last week, the Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force argues the opposite. The 69-page document states that fully reopening schools and universities constitutes the \u201chighest risk\u201d for continuing to spread the virus in the fall.While Republicans continue to search for a winning message on the virus, Democrats up and down the ballot have sought to exploit their opponents\u2019 mixed messages.

During that time, he has had a very full plate: deadly tornadoes, the flooding of the capital city of Jackson, violence in the state prisons, a vote to take down the flag with the Confederate battle emblem.But the coronavirus has eclipsed all of that, and in recent days, the virus was threatening the statehouse and his own house a few blocks away.Mr. Reeves, 46, was tested for the virus, as were his wife and three daughters.

Interviews with aides, advisers and others involved in the coronavirus response efforts of seven governors revealed just how much the crisis has upended their offices, their lives, and how they approach the job. For some, it has magnified their weaknesses and drawn out tensions even within their own parties \u2014 and their own kitchen cabinets.The crisis reached a boiling point this month for some governors, as the virus spread and deaths increased in a swath of states that governors had reopened. By this week, the outbreak was growing across 39 states, from hotspots across the Sunbelt to new surges emerging in the nation\u2019s middle. Florida reported the highest single-day total of new virus cases of any state \u2014 more than 15,000 \u2014 since the start of the pandemic.

Mr. Vance has raised only $29,000 for a re-election campaign, according to his disclosure forms.And some feminists and advocates for sex abuse victims have criticized the handling of sex crime cases by Mr. Vance\u2019s office.Through it all, Mr. Vance has not even announced whether he will seek a fourth term next year.Mr. Vance, 66, declined to be interviewed about his political plans.

Prosecutors said that during a search of the house, investigators found a cellphone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk \u2014 which they interpreted as \u201ca seemingly misguided effort to evade detection\u201d by law enforcement.\u201cAs these facts make plain, there should be no question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.The government\u2019s court filing came one day before a hearing in Manhattan on Ms. Maxwell\u2019s request for bail.In their filing, prosecutors sought to undermine a key argument made by Ms. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers last week in seeking her release on bail, that she had been trying to evade \u201cunrelenting and intrusive media coverage\u201d rather than law enforcement.Ms. Maxwell, 58, faces six counts that include transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and perjury. She has denied any wrongdoing.She had been in living in hiding, most recently in Bradford, N.H., in the mansion where she was arrested, prosecutors said. They said it was located on a 156-acre property that was acquired in an all-cash purchase in December by a limited liability company that concealed the buyer\u2019s identity.After Ms. Maxwell\u2019s arrest, a private security guard who worked on the property told the F.B.I. that he was given a credit card in the same name as the L.L.C. to make purchases on Ms. Maxwell\u2019s behalf, the prosecutors said in their filing Monday. The guard told the agents that Ms. Maxwell did not leave the property at all during his time there, according to prosecutors.The government has asked the judge, Alison J. Nathan of Federal District Court, to deny Ms. Maxwell bail. She had changed her email address, they said, and registered a new phone number under the name \u201cG Max.\u201dThe prosecutors have argued that she posed an \u201cextreme flight risk\u201d because of her financial resources. She had passports from three countries, and investigators said they had identified more than 15 bank accounts linked to her, the total balance of which at times exceeded $20 million.Between 2007 and 2011, the prosecutors had said, more than $20 million was moved from accounts associated with Mr. Epstein to accounts associated with Ms. Maxwell, who once was a fixture on New York\u2019s social scene. The government called her total financial picture \u201copaque and indeterminate.\u201dIn Ms. Maxwell\u2019s bail motion last week, her lawyers tried to distance her from Mr. Epstein.They denied that she posed a flight risk and asked Judge Nathan to release her into home confinement on a $5 million bond.\u201cGhislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d her lawyers wrote.Ms. Maxwell\u2019s arrest came one year after Mr. Epstein was charged with sexually exploiting and abusing girls and young women at his mansion in Manhattan and other locations. Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said that Ms. Maxwell had \u201centiced minor girls, got them to trust her, then delivered them into the trap that she and Epstein had set for them.\u201dMr. Epstein, 66, hanged himself last August in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where he was being held pending trial.Since her arrest, Ms. Maxwell has been in custody at a different federal jail, in Brooklyn."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/nyregion/mural-black-lives-matter-catskill.html", "title": "\u2018A Slap in the Face\u2019: N.Y.

In Chicago, one wording was painted over to read \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d In Palo Alto, Calif., artists blocked the street around a freshly laid painting after officials moved roadblocks, allowing it to be driven over.And in Catskill, on the western banks of the Hudson River, the debate over whether to allow a Black Lives Matter painting directly on Main Street has only exacerbated racial tensions in a village where just over a fifth of the population is Black.Many Black residents live in crumbling public housing, in de facto segregation from the pockets of rural retirees and transplanted Brooklynites, an experience so starkly different they say they might as well be living in two different towns.And it has left some Black residents wondering: To Catskill, do they matter?ImageVillage trustees rejected a Black Lives Matter painting along this section of Main Street.Credit...Cindy Schultz for The New York TimesMs. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town, says she no longer feels there\u2019s a place for her in the village she has lived in since she was 12. She is now looking to move. \u201cI kind of gave up,\u201d she said. \u201cEven with my voice, I gave up.\u201dShe spoke from a stoop where she lives in the Hop-O-Nose Homes, the public housing complex beside Catskill Creek, which runs southeast from the Catskill Mountains, emptying into the Hudson in the village.Nearly 70 percent of residents in public housing are people of color, according to the Catskill Housing Authority; the housing complex is close to where the alternate location of the painting was proposed to go along Water Street.The worn, low-slung red brick homes are just steps away but a world apart from the rapidly gentrifying main drag. There, a turmeric latte costs nearly $5, and \u201cBlack Trans Lives Matter\u201d signs rest in the windows of shops, some grasped in the arms of luxury bathrobes.Catskill has had a sizable Black population since at least the early 1800s, when the village was a prominent Hudson River port; by the latter part of the century, local historians said, the village drew Black families from the South.Nearly a century later, Catskill continued to attract Black residents, drawn in part by the construction of new public housing like Hop-O-Nose; in more recent years, a new wave of visitors from places like Brooklyn, lured by the scenery and cheap housing stock, has given the village a more trendy vibe.\u201cWhen you leave out of Hop-O-Nose, once you go out on Main Street, you see the Black Lives Matter signs here and there,\u201d Ms. Cross said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing Black on Main Street.\u201dOn June 4, that seemed to briefly change when hundreds of villagers marched down Main Street in a rally to denounce racism. Black residents took the microphone and shared racist incidents they had endured.It was one of a flurry of such marches that sprang up across the state. The high turnout in Catskill surprised some here in Greene County, where President Trump, who in recent days has called Black Lives Matter \u201ca symbol of hate,\u201d won 60 percent of the vote in 2016.The proposal to paint Black Lives Matter on Main Street materialized around the time of the march, attracting more than 3,500 supporters on a Change.org petition. But the village\u2019s five-member board of trustees \u2014 all of whom are white \u2014 rejected the painting proposal on June 30.They initially offered the Water Street location instead; when the organizers rejected that, the trustees offered the placement of two large banners saying \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d One could be strung across Main Street, stretching from the old 1920s vaudeville house-turned-cinema to the law offices of Brown, Kelleher & Zwickel, the other alongside the high-traffic New York State Route 9W.ImageVincent Seeley, president of Catskill\u2019s board of trustees, has offered to place two \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d banners in the village.Credit...Cindy Schultz for The New York TimesVincent Seeley, the president of the board, said the banners would get more visibility and last longer than paint underfoot. He said the village was attuned to its Black residents\u2019 needs, pointing to strides it had made on behalf of the public housing residents in recent years, including revamping the lease agreements, bringing in a new director and creating a position of a village board liaison for the housing complex.\u201cThe fact that they are not willing to work with me and hear me out is really upsetting to me,\u201d Mr. Seeley said, \u201cand does not feel like I am getting the credit for what we have done.\u201dSince the proposal, the village has fielded requests to hold a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d rally on Main Street, and to post an \u201cUnborn Child Lives Matter\u201d and an \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d banner, according to Mr. Seeley, who added that the village board might need to reconsider whether to allow any public messaging on its streets.Mr. Seeley said his counterproposal offering the Black Lives Matter banners was an effort to blend the wishes of the different constituencies that make up Catskill: the younger residents and transplants of all who races who want the painting, and an older, predominantly white population that doesn\u2019t.\u201cIt is my job to bridge that gap between the two. And we\u2019ve been doing a good job of that,\u201d he said as he stood on Main Street wearing an American flag face mask and holding an iced coffee from HiLo Catskill, a cafe, cocktail lounge and gallery. \u201cAnd then this ends up becoming the divisive thing.\u201dFor now, everything is on hold. The Black Lives Matter activists have rejected the board\u2019s offer of the banners; the village is still weighing whether to go forward.Image\u201cWe marched down the street with these folks, but when it came tine for action, they unanimously said no,\u201d said Quintin Cross, who is also a member of the Hudson/Catskill Housing Coalition.Credit...Cindy Schultz for The New York TimesAlong Main Street, where vintage Black Panther texts are displayed at the counter of the Magpie Bookshop and anti-racism messages have popped up on chalkboards outside restaurants, few people were willing to publicly voice opposition to the Black Lives Matter painting. Dissent has seemed to take place mainly under the cover of social media, where rancorous debates run rampant in comments.\u201cI thought all people\u2019s lives mattered,\u201d said a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II. The man, who was white and said he was against the painting, declined to give his name because of the sensitive nature of the subject.At the Mermaid Cafe on Main Street, Michelle Williams, the owner, stopped dishing up tacos to denounce the trustees\u2019 decision. Ms. Williams, who is white, said she was deeply affected by the searing stories she heard from her Black neighbors during the Catskill march. \u201cTo just have a bunch of people in their folding-chair thrones telling them \u2018no,\u2019 it\u2019s just really shortsighted,\u201d Ms. Williams said.\u201cYou have people who are playing both sides here,\u201d she added. \u201cBut what\u2019s the side?

The changes have led to a stark reduction in the number of excessive-force complaints against the police and have helped drive down the murder rate in what was once one of America\u2019s most dangerous cities.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to be a high-speed operator, we\u2019re probably not the right department,\u201d said the current chief, Joseph Wysocki, referring to the type of officer he does not want to attract. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to be a guardian figure in your neighborhood, this is for you.\u201dStill, even as many other communities look to Camden as a template for reform, it is far from a neat model.The disbanding of its old force seven years ago was prompted not by a desire to rethink policing, but by dire finances, a public safety crisis and a political power play meant to break the police officers\u2019 union. It took the drastic steps of firing all of the officers to allow the city to start fresh and overcome resistance.ImageEdwin Ramos and his wife, Katrina. Mr. Ramos said that the Camden police often treated the city as if it were hostile territory.Credit...Hannah Yoon for The New York TimesAt the start, and even today, the Camden department has followed many traditional policing practices. For example, it has embraced surveillance technology, including so-called predictive policing that relies on algorithms that can help develop patrol patterns. The technology is based on information like friendships, social media activity and past reports of crime that critics contend can reinforce racial biases.With parts of the city awash in drugs, the reconstituted force conducted a crackdown, which helped reduce violent crime. But it also issued many tickets for small infractions, the very approach that opponents of aggressive policing call unnecessarily punitive.That seemed to alienate residents the police were trying to win over. But as the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum several years ago, the department came to embrace a softer strategy that activists would like to see adopted elsewhere.The department also revamped the way it trains officers. It emphasizes defusing tense encounters, handing out fewer tickets for minor offenses and requiring officers to intervene if they see colleagues mistreating people.Police officials talk about the \u201csanctity of life\u201d as the overarching thread connecting many of the changes.Many people in Camden \u2014 a poor city of about 74,000 residents across the Delaware River from Philadelphia \u2014 said that overall, the changes had significantly improved their interactions with officers. They viewed the force as fairer, less menacing and more effective than in the past.\u201cFor the most part, it did work out,\u201d said Lary Steele, 41, a lifelong resident who works at Camden Tool, a supplier of industrial equipment. \u201cThe old cops used to grab us and whip our butt. A lot of the new guys are really nice.\u201dZaire Harris, 18, a recent graduate of Camden High School, said that officers were \u201crespectful and just want us to be peaceful with each other.\u201dImageLt. Gabriel Rodriguez, who was born and raised in Camden, also worked for the Police Department before it was revamped. He said he had been followed by officers when he was not in uniform.Credit...Hannah Yoon for The New York TimesStill, there is tension. Some residents described encounters that felt arbitrary and like harassment, echoing the concerns of residents in cities across the country: a jaywalking stop that escalated into a physical confrontation; a young woman who felt demeaned when an officer asked if she was a prostitute.\u201cThey have issues engaging with the community,\u201d said the Rev. Levi Combs III, 34, the pastor at First Refuge Progressive Baptist Church. \u201cThey\u2019re unable to see things other than black and white.\u201dIn a city where more than 90 percent of the residents are Black or Latino, slightly more than half of the police force\u2019s 400 officers are people of color. And, as is true in other cities, many Camden officers live in suburbs beyond the poor and working-class neighborhoods they patrol.\u201cThey don\u2019t know how to approach African-Americans or Hispanics because they don\u2019t come from that culture,\u201d Mr. Combs said.The killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis has touched off a searing national conversation about police brutality and racism and has inspired protests calling for the abolishment or shrinking of police forces.In New York City, the police commissioner disbanded dozens of plainclothes teams known for their aggressive tactics, and the city adopted a budget that reduced funding for the police.In Albuquerque, N.M. a plan is underway to reduce the role of the police in calls involving homelessness, addiction and mental health problems. In Minneapolis, the City Council has pledged to dismantle the police department and to seek \u201ca transformative new model\u201d for public safety.ImageSharim Anaya with her daughter, Makaila Rodriguez, 10.

The children\u2019s father made deliveries of medical supplies, she said.\u201cTheir parents were so in love with them,\u201d Ms. Abramova said.The crash, which was first reported by WPIX, happened near Raptor Point, a fishing area on the far northeast side of the field, said Daphne Yun, a spokeswoman for the Gateway National Recreation Area, which includes Floyd Bennett Field. Cars are allowed to drive on the runway during daylight hours, but the speed limit is 25 m.p.h.As of Sunday afternoon, no arrests had been made, and investigators were still combing through the scene of the collision.The deserted runways of the decommissioned airfield, which is in Marine Park, Brooklyn, near Jamaica Bay and is part of the National Park System, have attracted drag races in the past. But it was not immediately known if the two cars had been drag racing on Saturday evening.The crash came as drivers have taken advantage of empty streets during the coronavirus pandemic, sometimes openly drag racing on Sixth Avenue and the West Side Highway in Manhattan and other major commuting arteries in New York City. Traffic data showed average speeds up dramatically on city streets and highways.But there was no evidence on Sunday to indicate that this pandemic phenomenon played a part in Saturday\u2019s crash.Ms. Yun said Floyd Bennett Field is typically closed to the public after dark, but people are allowed to fish in some areas and are required to have special permits. She said entrances to the park remain open after dark.She said she did not know if the National Park Service had seen an uptick in drag racing on Floyd Bennett Field.\u201cRecently, that has not been something that\u2019s come up,\u201d she said.Floyd Bennett Field was opened in 1931 as New York City\u2019s first municipal airport.

It\u2019s a stance that could potentially be divisive, with some district surveys suggesting that more than half of parents would like their children to return to classrooms.Big districts like San Diego and smaller ones, like Marietta, Ga., are forging ahead with plans to open schools five days per week. Many other systems, like those in New York City and Seattle, hope to offer several days per week of in-person school.Adding to the confusion, optional guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May set out ambitious safety precautions for schools.

Discussions on potentially banning political ads have simmered since late last year, they said, as insiders weighed the idea while reaching out to political groups and candidates for feedback.But the issue has come to the forefront in recent weeks, with the November election looming and as Facebook grapples with intensifying scrutiny over content posted to its platform. The core of the debate is whether banning political ads would help or harm \u201cgiving users a voice,\u201d said the people with knowledge of the discussions. Stopping ads could stifle speech for some groups, they said, though allowing political ads to run could also allow more misinformation that could disenfranchise voters.A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported the potential change in policy.If a ban on political ads were to happen, it would be a reversal for Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. The social network has long allowed politicians and political parties to run ads across its network virtually unchecked, even if those ads contained falsehoods or other misinformation.Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he would not police politicians\u2019 ads and stated that the company was not an arbiter of truth because he believes in free speech. He has also said that removing political ads from the network could harm smaller, down-ballot candidates who are less well-funded than nationally prominent politicians. Political advertising makes up a negligible amount of Facebook\u2019s revenue, he has said, so any decision would not be based on financial considerations.But that hands-off approach has led to an intense backlash against the social network. Lawmakers, civil rights groups and Facebook\u2019s own employees have assailed it for letting hate speech and misinformation fester on its site. Last month, the Biden presidential campaign said it would begin urging its supporters to demand that Facebook strengthen its rules against misinformation. More recently, advertisers such as Unilever and Coca-Cola have paused their advertising on the platform in protest.That was punctuated this week by the release of a two-year audit of Facebook\u2019s policies. The audit, conducted by civil rights experts and lawyers who were handpicked by the company, concluded that Facebook had not done enough to protect people on the platform from discriminatory posts and ads. In particular, they said, Facebook had been too willing to let politicians run amok on the site.\u201cElevating free expression is a good thing, but it should apply to everyone,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhen it means that powerful politicians do not have to abide by the same rules that everyone else does, a hierarchy of speech is created that privileges certain voices over less powerful voices.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg has stuck to his free speech position even as other social media companies have taken more action against hate speech and inaccurate posts by politicians and their supporters. Twitter recently started labeling some of President Trump\u2019s tweets as untruthful or glorifying violence, while Snap has said it would stop promoting Mr. Trump\u2019s account on Snapchat because his speech could lead to violence. Twitch, the video game streaming site, suspended Mr. Trump\u2019s account entirely, and the internet forum Reddit banned a community of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters for harassment.Last year, Twitter said it would ban all political ads because the viral spread of misinformation presented challenges to civic discourse.Vanita Gupta, chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said it was positive that Facebook was thinking through its options but that \u201cwhat they need to have in place is a system that actually catches real-time voter misinformation.\u201d She added, \u201cVoter suppression is happening every day, and their inaction is going to have profound ramifications on the election.\u201dOn Friday, some of the top Democratic outside groups that are major spenders on Facebook said they had not discussed with the company any potential banning of political ads closer to the election. A spokesman for the D.N.C. referred questions to a tweet from Nellwyn Thomas, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief technology officer, who wrote on Friday: \u201cWe said it seven months ago to @Google and we will say it again to @Facebook: a blunt ads ban is not a real solution to disinformation on your platform.\u201dDemocratic officials have argued that blanket bans or restrictions on political ads are not a sufficient way to root out disinformation, particularly as that kind of content can spread in closed Facebook groups. Banning ads also restricts important digital tools that campaigns have come to rely on for activities such as acquiring new donors and raising money to getting out the vote, they said.Some Democrats added that the Trump campaign has a significant structural advantage on Facebook, having built up a community of more than 28.3 million followers. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has only around 2.1 million followers on the social network. Removing the ability to pay for ads would give Mr. Trump a far greater reach online than Mr. Biden, they said.A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Facebook is by far the preferred and most popular platform for campaigns. The Trump campaign has spent more than $55 million on Facebook since 2018, and the Biden campaign has spent more than $25 million.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Nick Corasaniti from New York."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/technology/tiktok-amazon-security-risk.html", "title": "Amazon Backtracks From Demand That Employees Delete TikTok", "summary": "TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been under scrutiny as a potential national security threat.", "authors": "By Mike Isaac and Karen Weise", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon on Friday asked its employees to delete the Chinese-owned video app TikTok from their cellphones, putting the tech giant at the center of growing suspicion and paranoia about the app.Almost five hours later, Amazon reversed course, saying the email to workers was sent in error.In the initial email, which was obtained by The New York Times, Amazon officials said that because of \u201csecurity risks,\u201d employees must delete the app from any devices that \u201caccess Amazon email.\u201d Employees had to remove the app by Friday to remain able to obtain mobile access to their Amazon email, the note said.In a statement sent later on Friday, company spokeswoman Kristin Brown said, \u201cThere is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok.\u201dBut by then, the initial email had already added to the storm surrounding TikTok, which has been popular with young audiences in the United States for its short, fun videos and is owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance. Because of its Chinese ownership and heightened tensions between the United States and China over issues such as trade and technology dominance, TikTok has come under increasing scrutiny in Washington over its security.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, said on Monday that the Trump administration was considering blocking some Chinese apps, which he has called a threat to national security. Many users who have built community and business on TikTok are fearful of a broad ban. Some Amazon employees publicly shared dismay at not being able to use the app.Last year, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American firms on national security grounds, opened a national security review of ByteDance\u2019s acquisition of the American company, Musical.ly, which eventually became TikTok.In December, the Defense Department began telling military personnel to delete the app from government-issued phones. The same month, the Democratic National Committee warned campaigns, committees and state parties about TikTok\u2019s \u201cChinese ties and potentially sending data back to the Chinese government.\u201d With TikTok making headlines for similar security concerns, the D.N.C. reiterated the previous warnings about TikTok in one of its regular security emails this week.Other companies are scrutinizing use of the app among employees. Wells Fargo said it told some workers who had installed TikTok on company-owned phones to delete the app. \u201cDue to concerns about TikTok\u2019s privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices,\u201d a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said in a statement.ByteDance has made a series of moves in response to the concerns. The company said that it would separate TikTok from much of its Chinese operations, and that users\u2019 personal data would be stored in the United States and not in China. In May, ByteDance hired Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, to be chief executive of TikTok based in Los Angeles. It has said that managers outside China call the shots on key aspects of its business, including rules about data.On Monday, TikTok also said that it would withdraw from app stores in Hong Kong, where a new national security law from China was enacted. The company said it would make the app inoperable to users there within a few days.After Amazon\u2019s first email on Friday, TikTok said in a statement that user security was \u201cof the utmost importance\u201d and that it was committed to user privacy. It added, \u201cWhile Amazon did not communicate to us before sending their email, and we still do not understand their concerns, we welcome a dialogue.\u201dBefore Amazon sent out its second message on Friday, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has called for investigations into the national security ramifications of Chinese apps, said, \u201cThe whole federal government should follow suit.\u201dTikTok has long been a concern of American intelligence officials, who fear the social networking app is a thinly veiled data collection service. Over the past six months, security researchers have only furthered those concerns with a series of discoveries.Last month, a researcher uncovered that TikTok had the ability to siphon off anything a user copied to a clipboard on a smartphone \u2014 passwords, photos and other sensitive data like Social Security numbers, emails and texts. The researcher began posting the findings on the online message board Reddit.The researcher, who goes by the handle Bangorlol, also said that TikTok was capturing data about a user\u2019s phone hardware and data on other apps installed on the phone. Many of these abilities are found in other apps, but TikTok\u2019s developers had gone out of their way to prevent anyone from analyzing the app, the researcher said.\u201cThis was very concerning and very rare,\u201d Oded Vanunu, who leads research into product vulnerability at the Israeli security firm Check Point, said about the findings. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of fear and speculation about this app, but the recent findings are raising big questions.\u201dTikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership has also been problematic for other governments. India banned nearly 60 Chinese mobile apps including TikTok last month, citing national security concerns. India and China recently clashed along a disputed border, leaving 20 Indian soldiers dead and an unknown number of Chinese casualties.The video app has soared in popularity over the past few years, especially among teenagers and young adults, who use it to make and share short videos. The app has minted its own influencers, with celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon also posting their own videos on it. Young people on TikTok have also recently exercised their political clout by claiming to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets for one of President Trump\u2019s recent campaign rallies as a prank \u2014 and then not showing up.The app has been downloaded roughly two billion times worldwide, according to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower. About 170 million of those downloads were from users in the United States. It has been installed more than 610 million times in India.TikTok has been viewed as a competitive threat by some American internet companies, which are eager to tap into younger audiences. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has said that he worries about the popularity of TikTok, and his company has been building competing products like Reels, an app similar to TikTok that capitalizes on the social video format.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Karen Weise from Seattle.

A soft-spoken cryptocurrency mogul is paying for a private network of high-definition security cameras around the city. Zoom in and you can see the finest details: the sticker on a cellphone, the make of a backpack, the color of someone\u2019s eyes.But in San Francisco, a city with a decades-long anti-authority streak, from hippies and pioneering gay rights activists to the techno-utopian libertarians and ultra-progressives of today, the crypto mogul has found a surprisingly receptive audience.Here\u2019s why: While violent crime is not high in the city, property crime is a constant headache. Anyone who lives here knows you shouldn\u2019t leave anything \u2014 not a pile of change, not a scarf \u2014 in a parked car. Tourists visiting the city\u2019s vistas like Twin Peaks or the famously windy Lombard Street are easy marks. The city government has struggled to solve the problem.In the middle of this is Chris Larsen, a 59-year-old tech industry veteran, paying for hundreds of cameras. He sees it as an alternative system of urban security, and he hopes it becomes a model for other cities.This just may be the best moment for him to explain why a rich guy paying for surveillance cameras all over a city is not a terrifying invasion of privacy. Around the country, Black Lives Matter movement protests have led to a reckoning on policing and how it should be done. Many of the activists leading this movement are fighting to abolish or defund \u2014 reduce funding for \u2014 police departments. Last week in New York, for example, the mayor announced the police budget would be cut by $1 billion.In San Francisco, where many locals push for this kind of police reform, those same locals are tired of the break-ins. So how do they reconcile \u201cdefund the police\u201d with \u201cstop the smash and grabs\u201d?Mr. Larsen believes he has the answer: Put security cameras in the hands of neighborhood groups. Put them everywhere. He\u2019s happy to pay for it.The local cryptocurrency guyImage\u201cThey don\u2019t care if they\u2019re being seen,\u201d Chris Larsen said of smash-and-grab thieves in San Francisco.Credit...Cayce Clifford for The New York TimesFirst, let\u2019s state the obvious reason \u2014 besides privacy concerns \u2014 that Mr. Larsen\u2019s plan might be viewed with suspicion: He\u2019s in tech.Longtime San Francisco residents and the tech workers have not historically seen eye-to-eye on many things. The natives resent the private tech shuttle buses and the spiraling cost of living brought on by the new arrivals. They even resent their housing aesthetic: Glass and metal and pretty Victorian houses now painted in shades of black and gray.But here\u2019s where it gets more complicated: Privatization is hardly a new thing in the city. Around a quarter of San Francisco parents send their children to private school, a higher percentage than many large cities, including New York. Private security officers are a common sight. Plenty of people already have security cameras pointing toward the street. So would a privately owned camera network be so out of bounds?And Mr. Larsen is no tech carpetbagger. He grew up in a middle-class family in the Bay Area. His father worked the night shift as a mechanic at the San Francisco airport. In 1984, he graduated from San Francisco State University, and he is now a major benefactor, donating one of the largest gifts the school has ever received. He also has been a longtime advocate for privacy, cofounding the coalition Californians for Privacy Now to help pass a 2004 privacy bill, California S.B.1, commonly known as the California Financial Information Privacy Act.In 1997, Mr. Larsen co-founded an online lending company called E-Loan, which went public two years later, and he stayed on as chief executive until 2005. In 2012, he co-founded a start-up that would be called Ripple, which helped people send money online using so-called blockchain technology and the digital token called XRP. During the peak of the speculator-crazed crypto boom of 2017, its value spiked wildly. Mr. Larsen became one of the few crypto entrepreneurs to make and then hang onto that overnight fortune.His apartment on Russian Hill has a trophy view of San Francisco Bay and the tight curves of Lombard Street. But also: the crews coming in to rob tourists\u2019 cars, right in the middle of the day. Mr. Larsen watches the police drive by, and the criminals arriving 15 seconds later, smashing the vehicles\u2019 windows and stealing luggage.\u201cThey don\u2019t care at all \u2014 they don\u2019t care if they\u2019re being seen,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s brazen.\u201dHis father-in-law\u2019s car was robbed. Mr. Larsen\u2019s own car windows were smashed. When a group of men climbed into his garden and one of them cut the wires on his home security system, while his children were sleeping inside, Mr. Larsen decided that he had had enough.The camera networkImageMr. Larsen began funding camera surveillance in 2012; now his project covers 135 blocks.Credit...Cayce CliffordWhen I wrote to Mr. Larsen asking for an interview, he immediately said yes, and he answered all of my questions. He said he knew that what he was doing might raise concerns, so he wanted to be open about it.Here is what he is doing: Writing checks for nearly $4 million to buy cameras that record high-definition video of the streets and paying to have them maintained by a company called Applied Video Solutions The rest is up to locals in neighborhood coalitions like Community Benefit Districts, nonprofits formed to provide services to the area.Here is how the project works: Neighbors band together and decide where to put the cameras. They are installed on private property at the discretion of the property owner, and in San Francisco many home and business owners want them. The footage is monitored by the neighborhood coalition. The cameras are always recording.The cameras are not hidden. Mr. Larsen believes they can serve as both deterrent and aid in investigations, but it is difficult to say how effective they have been in reducing overall crime.Camera surveillance is happening in a lot of cities, but usually it is managed by police departments. In London, there are around 420,000 closed-circuit cameras, according to a 2017 report by the Brookings Institution, and the city has begun testing using facial recognition software. In New York, too, cameras are common. In Newark, anyone with an internet connection can watch the streets from the city\u2019s police cameras, which have a Newark police department placard to warn that the area is under surveillance.San Francisco is unique in that the cameras are not being installed and monitored by the police but by private citizens, and it is unique in that one person is paying for so much of it.Mr. Larsen started installing them in 2012 with just a few around his neighborhood. These days, he funds a network of more than 1,000. He funds the C.B.D.s to control and monitor them. He funds the longstanding nonprofit SF Safe, which supports neighborhood watch groups and the Police Department.Some of the city\u2019s densest neighborhoods and commercial corridors \u2014 like Union Square, Japantown, Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, the Tenderloin and Russian Hill \u2014 have signed on, and now the network includes 135 blocks.\u201cYou think they have all these video banks in their police stations? No. Mostly they don\u2019t have decent internet connections,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cSo we helped pay for some internet connections.\u201dFrom Japantown\u2019s restaurants and nursing homes to the Union Square shopping district, business and homeowners have welcomed his cameras. Every neighborhood has sought to expand their program since installing. As proponents of Mr. Larsen\u2019s network see things, they get the safety of a surveillance state without the state.\u201cIf you went to the board of supervisors and asked the members to approve this, you\u2019d end up having a conversation about government and surveillance,\u201d said Simon Bertrang, the head of a community benefit district, a coalition of businesses, residents and property owners in the Tenderloin.A few of the neighborhoods watch the footage live, others don\u2019t. If someone wants the footage \u2014 a police officer or a crime victim or a defense lawyer \u2014 they ask the neighborhood coalition for it.His ally in all of this is someone very different and a little surprising: Chesa Boudin, the new, ultraprogressive district attorney of San Francisco.Mr. Boudin, a fiery lawyer who wants radical policing and sentencing reform, became San Francisco\u2019s district attorney in January. And he won despite a ferocious $700,000 opposition campaign by the city Police Department\u2019s union. Now, the 39-year-old Mr. Boudin, son of two members of the militant organization Weather Underground, has elevated the calls to defund police departments.\u201cIn less than 24 hours my office has received over 1,000 emails demanding that San Francisco defund the police department,\u201d he tweeted on June 5.Mr. Boudin likes Mr. Larsen and vice versa.The community groupsImageMembers of community groups, not the police, monitor the feeds from the cameras, which record continually.Credit...Cayce Clifford for The New York TimesIn January, Mr. Larsen and Mr. Boudin met in Japantown and walked to its Community Benefit District office. It was a small office with three desks, one tiny dog bed, and two large screens with live video of the streets. The screens are monitored by the two-person benefit district staff. That equipment is paid for by Mr. Larsen. The rest was paid by the benefit district members.The myriad C.B.D.s, coalitions of local property owners, had mostly been around since the mid-2000s, so Mr. Larsen used that infrastructure as the local organizing unit to take his funding and use his supplier at Applied Video Solutions to buy and install cameras. They said the footage was only stored locally within each C.B.D. office and erased after 30 days.In Japantown, the group mostly uses the cameras to find where a car window has been shattered or trash has been dumped so they can send the neighborhood\u2019s private cleanup crew, paid for by local property owners. Other events they report to the police department. There was the bike theft, the phone theft, the backpacks and purses. One time a golden retriever was stolen, and they sent the footage to the San Francisco Police Department, which used the cameras to track him down.Dmitri Shimolin, the head of Applied Video Solutions in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, was at the computer leading the demonstration. He zoomed in to show the quality of footage the cameras were getting.\u201cAn arrest was made from some footage, and we called the guy \u2018Dimples\u2019 because you could see the dimples on his face,\u201d Mr. Shimolin said.The image quality from the cameras is much better than typical home-security cameras like Ring or Nest, and the field of vision is larger. It is arguably more compelling evidence in court because the video is monitored by a third-party intermediary who can testify that it is a continuous feed. It is time stamped. And because the network covers many blocks, the footage can tell a broader story than a single camera about an event that might be moving from block to block, in the case of, for example, a fight.One side effect of the cameras is that when one C.B.D. installs them, it seems to push crime just a few blocks away, Mr. Larsen said.\u201cIt\u2019s whack-a-mole,\u201d Mr. Larsen said.The same day as the Japantown meeting, Mr. Larsen and Mr. Boudin drove to the C.B.D. headquarters in the Tenderloin, the city\u2019s roughest neighborhood. They sat at a folding table with about 10 people. Conspicuously not present: anyone from the Police Department.Last year, someone was shot dead right in front of the office during a team meeting. Shootings have more than doubled in the neighborhood, up 130 percent in a year, they said. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, the number of tents for homeless people in the neighborhood had ballooned from around 120 to around 400, until a lawsuit from local residents led the city to move the tent-dwellers into safe sleeping sites, the group\u2019s leader, Mr. Bertrang, said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a good law enforcement response right now,\u201d Mr. Boudin told the group. \u201cIt takes 10 cops to do a single drug bust, costs $20,000 or something. And I don\u2019t want my attorneys to be doing this for no benefit on the street.\u201dHe said the more effective strategy would be to focus on the crime ring leaders, rather than the people on the sidewalks.The surveillance footage is completely deleted after 30 days, and Mr. Boudin wondered if it could be stored longer, giving his office more time to put a case together.\u201cSixty days would be nice,\u201d Mr. Boudin said. \u201cA preliminary hearing has to happen within 60 days.\u201dThe district attorney knows the alliance is a curious one. If the goal is to reduce the power of police, private donors like Mr. Larsen can be extremely helpful. But he worries their help can also involve private individuals too deeply in crime-fighting, and he is not sure how much to lean on Mr. Larsen. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is where his work ends, right?\u201d Mr. Boudin said. \u201cThere\u2019s real risks.\u201dThe privacy fearsImageThe San Francisco police do not collaborate with Mr. Larsen on the camera project.\u00a0Credit...Cayce Clifford for The New York TimesThe protest movement that is rocking police departments around the country hinges on videos. The shaking cellphone videos of killings have captured moments so irrefutable that it has inspired rage from more corners than just longtime police reform activists. Calls to defund police departments are getting real traction.And into this Mr. Larsen presents his solution: Go around the police.\u201cThis has underscored the importance of not just cameras but of communitywide camera coverage,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cBody cams show some pretty core weaknesses because we don\u2019t have universal access to police body cam footage, and there\u2019s a fundamental conflict of interest if the video shows something bad for the department.\u201dThe answer is more cameras, he said, and then keep that footage in the hands of citizens.\u201cWe do not work with Mr. Larsen,\u201d a police department spokesman wrote in an email. \u201cThere is a process for the department to request footage from the party that manages the cameras. That party has the discretion whether or not to release footage to S.F.P.D.\u201dWhen crime-fighting is put into civilian hands, new and unregulated behaviors can emerge. San Francisco\u2019s police are controlled by many laws that do not apply to civilians. One of those laws is that the police in the city may not use facial-recognition technology.\u201cSan Francisco has passed a very sophisticated surveillance ordinance that bans facial recognition by the Police Department, but yet you have these independent agencies within the city limits making their own decisions,\u201d said Dave Maass, a senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group.The technology that Mr. Larsen is using is sophisticated \u2014 video management from Motorola Solutions, evidence management from Genetec. Those same cameras, and the software supporting them, can be used for more than what they are currently doing.\u201cThis is a system that is designed to scale up to do license plate reading and facial recognition,\u201d Mr. Maass said. \u201cThat is where it\u2019s going.\u201dMr. Larsen balked at the idea of his cameras using facial recognition: \u201cWe\u2019re strongly opposed to facial recognition technology,\u201d he said. \u201cFacial recognition is too powerful given the lack of laws and protections to make it acceptable.\u201dCircumventing the police means a lot of people now can make decisions about how crime is handled, and watchdogs worry about cameras being used for spotty or biased monitoring of the community. Putting more power over security into the hands of local leaders does not mean that power necessarily will be used wisely.\u201cThere is distrust of law enforcement, and so there are these community efforts to self-police,\u201d said Daniel Lawrence, principal research associate at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. But, he added, \u201cthere needs to be some sort of system that ensures the laws of society are applicable to everybody.\u201dMr. Larsen acknowledged the issue.He argued that trust will come in the form of full city camera coverage, so police can play a smaller, more subtle role. Individual vigilantism will not work, he argued, but strong neighborhoods with continuous video feeds on every corner will.\u201cThat\u2019s the winning formula,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cPure coverage.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/technology/virtual-cycling.html", "title": "Sports in a Pandemic Don\u2019t All Stink", "summary": "Virtual cycling offers lessons for how other sports can appeal to fans leading increasingly digital lives.", "authors": "By Shira Ovide", "text": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter.

Chen", "text": "When we buy a gadget these days, we rarely assume that it will endure.We expect to play a video game console only for as long as companies make games for it. We expect to use a smartphone or a laptop for just as long as the battery has juice or until it can no longer run important software.At some point, we feel that we must upgrade. We must have the latest and greatest camera. We must have apps that run faster. We must have brighter screens.Here\u2019s the thing: This is all the doing of marketing professionals, seared into our subconscious. The reality is that consumer electronics, such as your phone, computer or tablet, can last for many years. It just takes some research to obtain tech that will endure. This exercise will be increasingly important in a pandemic-induced recession, which has forced many of us to tighten our spending.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of buying what you need, not what the company is telling you that you need,\u201d said Carole Mars, the director of technical development and innovation at the Sustainability Consortium, which studies the sustainability of consumer goods.Strategically choosing tech with a longer shelf life is not intuitive. It involves assessing how easy or not it is to repair a particular product and determining when it makes sense to invest more money. Here are some questions to consider for the long run.Is the tech easy to repair?The next time you shop for an electronic product, try this exercise: Before you buy it, find out whether you or a professional can easily fix it. If so, then go for it. If it\u2019s too difficult, make it a hard pass.Vincent Lai, who works for the Fixers\u2019 Collective, a social club in New York that repairs aging devices, offered several approaches to assessing whether a gadget can be straightforwardly fixed:Consult iFixit, a website that offers instructions on gadget repairs. For some products, the site tears apart gadgets and does an analysis on its ease of repair. Apple\u2019s iPhone SE, for example, has a repairability score of 6 out of 10 (10 being the easiest to repair), so it could be a device worth considering for the long haul.Check if local technicians can service the device. Plenty of technicians have the parts and ability to service popular phones like iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. But if you want to buy a handset from a less popular brand, like OnePlus or Motorola, it\u2019s worth calling around first to find out if anyone can fix it in case something goes wrong.Find out whether there\u2019s a community of enthusiasts. Sometimes there are no local fixers who can help with a product, but there may be enthusiasts who write their own guides that you can follow. While you probably can\u2019t find someone to repair a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush that is out of warranty, there are instructions on how to service it on iFixit.Is the battery replaceable?One of the clearest indicators of a product\u2019s durability is whether the batteries are replaceable. Gadgets that work without wires are powered by a lithium-ion battery, which can be charged only a finite number of times before it deteriorates.Fortunately, most phones and laptops have batteries that can be replaced by professionals. But more compact products have components that are glued together and tightly sealed up, making their batteries impossible to replace. Wireless earphones like Apple\u2019s AirPods and Bose\u2019s QuietComfort 35 are examples of popular products with irreplaceable batteries. Once the batteries die, you have to buy a brand-new pair.So if you\u2019re buying anything with a battery \u2014 including digital picture frames, wireless security cameras and Bluetooth speakers \u2014 do a web search to see if the battery can be replaced. If not, consider it disposable.Is the product reliable?Like household appliances, tech products have failure rates \u2014 the ratio of working to defective units. These rates can give you a sense of a brand\u2019s reliability.Consumer Reports, well known for publishing reliability ratings for household appliances, compiles similar reliability data for smartphones, laptops, tablets, TVs and printers by surveying subscribers who own the products.People tend to have more problems with products that have moving parts, like printers with ink cartridges, than with electronics like TVs or tablets, said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. Brother printers fared well in the publication\u2019s surveys. For phones, Apple and Samsung had strong reliability ratings.Mr. Lai of the Fixers\u2019 Collective recommends a grass-roots approach to assessing reliability. He reads web forums like Reddit to see what people are saying about a product. If a large number of customers report problems with the device, he said, he steers clear.Should I spend more?Another rule of thumb to consider is investing more in a product to make it last. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to buy the most expensive phone or computer on the market. But it does mean investing in configurations that will make you happier in the long run, said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer for Wirecutter, a New York Times publication that tests products.Let\u2019s use an iPad as an example. If you wanted an iPad, you could pay $329 for the base model with 32 gigabytes of storage. But it\u2019s probably a better idea to spend $429 on the model with 128 gigabytes of storage \u2014 that\u2019s quadruple the capacity, which you can use to hold apps, games, photos and videos for years to come.In tech parlance, this strategy is known as \u201cfutureproofing.\u201dIf you\u2019re turned off by the idea of spending more, there\u2019s a way around that. You can look to buy the same higher-priced product refurbished \u2014 meaning it was returned by a customer and restored to its former glory \u2014 for a significant discount, Dr. Mars said.Is the software easy to update?Because many modern gadgets, like smartphones and tablets, mostly lack moving parts, their software plays a strong role in determining their longevity. After a company stops providing software updates to a device, you can expect to run into problems, such as your favorite apps ceasing to work properly.This is where an iPhone has an edge over an Android. Each year, when Apple releases a new operating system for the iPhone, it generally works on phones as far back as five years ago. (Apple\u2019s iOS 14, due for release this fall, will support the iPhone 6S from 2015.) That means when you buy an iPhone, it will probably get new features and stability improvements for at least five years.Android users will have a tougher time. Typically, manufacturers provide software updates to Android devices for two or three years.To get around that, Android users might turn to the grass-roots community. For some Android phones, Mr. Lai said, there are enthusiasts who offer so-called ROMs, or custom-made operating systems, which can be installed to keep the software up to date. Check the website XDA Developers to see whether tinkerers are building custom software for the Android phone you intend to buy.Does it solve a problem?Many so-called smart home gadgets \u2014 ordinary appliances with wireless sensors and an internet connection \u2014 offer interesting benefits, like a refrigerator with a camera that sends an alert to our phone when the milk is running low.Just keep in mind that smart home products can create more problems than they solve. A trash can that automatically opens its lid when you wave your hand over it may feel magical, but it relies on batteries and moving parts that eventually wear out.\u201cIf it moves, if it flashes, if it can connect to the internet and tattle on you, it\u2019s an electronic,\u201d Dr. Mars said, \u201cand you\u2019re inheriting all the issues that come with an electronic.\u201dIt all comes back to buying what you truly need. Sometimes a \u201cdumb\u201d product will do just fine."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/health/vision-problems-technology-headsets.html", "title": "Technology Bridges the Gap to Better Sight", "summary": "More than 6 million Americans have vision problems that cannot be corrected by glasses or contact lenses. Companies like IrisVision are creating headsets to help them see better.", "authors": "By Janet Morrissey", "text": "This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series, which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve.When Jimmy Blakley signed up to serve his country during the Vietnam War, his health and vision were pristine. But shortly after finishing his service in 1971, Mr. Blakley\u2019s vision began to sharply deteriorate.He said doctors discovered signs of Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide used during the war, in his blood, and told him it was likely the cause of his vision loss. Over the years he had surgery and eye injections, but became legally blind in 1999. He used magnifiers on top of glasses to read and needed to sit two feet away to watch his 65-inch TV. He was frustrated.Then Mr. Blakley, now 72 and living in College Station, Tex., learned about IrisVision, a device that uses a smartphone, virtual reality headset and algorithms to help people with poor vision see and read clearly. For Mr. Blakley, it was life-changing.\u201cI was amazed,\u201d he said. \u201cI was seeing the bottom of the eye chart; it was like being 19 again.\u201dAmong companies using technology to address vision problems, IrisVision is working to go a step further: Its device, in addition to improving sight, is expected to be able to diagnose conditions and test and even treat patients remotely within the next two years.\u201cIt\u2019s not aesthetically pleasing but it does something that really provides a useful function for people,\u201d said Jerome Wujek, program director and research resources officer at the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. \u201cWe are visual animals. If you lose your vision, you lose a big chunk of your life.\u201d He said devices that used artificial intelligence to test, diagnose and treat remotely were the future as they would allow ophthalmologists, optometrists and others to treat people in rural and underserved areas.The market for this technology could be huge. About 6.4 million Americans have low vision that cannot be corrected by glasses or contact lenses, according to a 2016 National Academy of Sciences report. Of those, 4.2 million are older than 40. And as the \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of aging baby boomers sweeps the nation, age-related eye diseases and conditions, like macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, are expected to surge.The coronavirus outbreak has made it particularly challenging for the visually impaired. People with low vision rely heavily on touch and sound to identify objects and people, and this can be tough while following hand sanitizing and social distancing practices, and listening to people through masks, said Dr. L. Penny Rosenblum, director of research at the American Foundation for the Blind, who has congenital cataracts and glaucoma. Those with low vision can also find themselves even more isolated if they are unable to use Zoom and other technology to stay connected, Dr. Rosenblum added.ImageFrank Werblin, a founder of the company, said he had long been fascinated by the relationship between brain neurons, the retina and vision.Credit...IrisVisionFrank Werblin, co-founder and chief scientist at IrisVision and a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, for more than 40 years, came up with the idea for IrisVision in 2014. While speaking at a Foundation Fighting Blindness conference, a board trustee, J. Lynn Dougan, approached him, offering to provide funding if Dr. Werblin could invent a wearable device that could help his vision-impaired daughter. Dr. Werblin said he had been fascinated by the relationship between brain neurons, the retina and vision, and eagerly accepted the challenge.Along the way, Dr. Werblin brought in a tech-savvy mobile app developer, Ammad Khan, as a partner. \u201cImagining a concept that would transform somebody\u2019s life was very compelling for me,\u201d Mr. Khan said.With $1.5 million from Mr. Dougan, a $1.5 million grant from the National Eye Institute, and about $4 million from angel investors and venture capitalists, the co-founders got to work. They collaborated with experts from Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities, and partnered with Samsung, which provided the smartphone, the augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies, and the mobile artificial intelligence platform. By 2017, the device was ready.IrisVision helps restore visual function to people with such conditions as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosis, Stargardt disease, glaucoma and optic atrophy \u2014 but not cataracts. It can help someone with visual acuity as low as 20/1000. (Acuity measures sharpness: A 20/200 acuity, for example, means a person can make out an object at a distance of 20 feet that a normal vision person could see from 200 feet.)So how does it work?IrisVision helps the brain use parts of the eyes that still function properly. The smartphone\u2019s camera captures an image, and then the virtual reality, or V.R., headset and algorithms enhance the image by providing enough information to fill in the gaps and remap the scene to provide a complete picture.The company recently added voice control, video streaming, Alexa and other interactive features that give those with low vision easy access to news, weather updates, YouTube videos and TV shows viewed within the headset. The person can adjust the headset, by voice command or button, to zoom in or adjust the color, contrast or brightness.Still, the device has its shortcomings: It is large and clunky, and the user needs to be stationary \u2014 not walking around \u2014 to use it. In addition, at $2,950, it is expensive. And unless you are a veteran, health insurers do not cover the cost.ImageWithin two years, Mr. Khan said, the plan is that an updated model will be able to diagnose and treat eye conditions remotely.Credit...Cayce Clifford for The New York TimesIrisVision has seen an increase in sales during the pandemic, rising 50 percent in June from the same month a year ago, according to Mr. Khan. He said most of the devices were now being sold directly to consumers, as clinics where people often purchased them had shut down during the outbreak. IrisVision ships the devices to homes and then helps buyers set up the technology remotely.A number of other companies are also working to address issues with low vision, like NuEyes, eSight, Patriot Vision, OrCam, Vispero and Aira. Patriot\u2019s ViewPoint, Vispero\u2019s Compact 6 HD Wear, and NuEyes e2 all offer V.R. headsets similar to IrisVision\u2019s, although magnification, field of view and other features vary among models. Some devices, like e2 and Compact Wear, are less expensive but offer fewer features.They also vary in size and weight. NuEyes Pro, eSight, and Vispero\u2019s Jordy resemble oversized sunglasses or ski goggles and are designed for walking down the street, visiting museums or shopping, which IrisVision is not. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the very, very early days,\u201d said Kjell Carlsson, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. He said the size and price would need to come down before the devices became mainstream.The differences in devices mean that one may suit a person or a condition better than another.\u201cThe IrisVision was too pixilated and the image \u2018too big\u2019 for me,\u201d Dr. Rosenblum said, adding that her friend\u2019s 91-year old mother, who had macular degeneration, loved IrisVision. \u201cOne device doesn\u2019t fit all.\u201dIrisVision has the backing of Brook Byers, who invested in 2017 and has since pumped more than $3 million into the company. Mr. Byers, a senior partner and a co-founder at Kleiner Perkins, a venture capital firm that invested early in Amazon, Google and Twitter, has retinal issues in one eye stemming from an accident when he was 11.\u201cI tried it on in my office. I have a really, really bad eye, and wow, I could see with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an aha moment.\u201dMr. Byers said he was particularly excited about the company\u2019s next steps. IrisVision\u2019s updated model, expected later this year, will be able to test and diagnose eye conditions remotely. And, Mr. Khan said, the treatment component should be added within two years.\u201cThe great value of this device isn\u2019t that it simply restores vision,\u201d Dr. Werblin said. \u201cBut it brings people back to life.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/technology/personaltech/make-your-tech-last-longer.html", "title": "How to Make Your Tech Last Longer", "summary": "In a pandemic-induced recession, it\u2019s more important than ever to take care of our smartphones and other gadgets.", "authors": "By Brian X. Chen", "text": "With so many people becoming unemployed in the pandemic-induced recession, we have no choice but to handle our technology differently. Put another way: We need to make our tech last longer.We generally do a poor job of this. As soon as a device like a smartphone starts to feel slow or its battery deteriorates, we conclude that it\u2019s time to buy a new one \u2014 so we upgrade.\u201cPeople just like to spend, spend, spend \u2014 they say, I don\u2019t want to fix it, I\u2019ll just get a new phone,\u201d said Shakeel Taiyab, who runs a business repairing phones and computers in South San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s $200 to fix your phone, now you want to spend another $1,500? People don\u2019t do the math.\u201dThe tech companies have generally helped nurture this behavior, of course. Many phone makers gave us incentives to buy new devices regularly, for example, while offering scarce education on steps to help our tech endure.But with so many people now dealing with shrinking funds, making our tech last longer makes common sense and is not so hard. Basic maintenance includes replacing batteries, cleaning out dust and purging unnecessary files that bog down our devices.If we put a small amount of time into caring for our gadgets, they can last indefinitely. We\u2019d also be doing the world a favor. By elongating the life of our gadgets, we put more use into the energy, materials and human labor invested in creating the product.We don\u2019t have to do all this on our own, either. There are people out there willing to help. With retail stores for Apple and Microsoft shutting down in the pandemic and unable to service our gadgets, hiring a local fixer is now as good an idea as ever. It just takes some homework.So here are some of the most effective steps you can take to squeeze as much life as possible out of your phones, tablets and computers without breaking the bank.Check Your BatteryStart thinking about your device batteries as if they were car tires and replace accordingly. Because batteries can be charged only a finite number of times before they deteriorate, they will be one of the first things to go on mobile devices and laptops.For different types of gadgets, your battery mileage may vary. Generally, a smartphone battery will last about two years, and ones for a laptop or smartphone will last three or four years before needing to be replaced, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a site that offers instructions on do-it-yourself gadget repairs.So how do you assess whether a battery needs replacing? There are various software tools you can use to check its health:Apple users with iPhones and iPads can open the Settings, then tap Battery and select Battery Health.Android devices have third-party apps like AccuBattery that can do a reading on your battery\u2019s health.Mac users can click on the Apple icon, then About This Mac and then System Report. Then click on Power to see a reading on battery health.Windows users can download the app BatteryInfoView to measure battery health.In general, pay attention to a battery\u2019s remaining capacity. The lower the capacity, the more short-lived your device gets. If your capacity is less than 60 percent, you should think about replacing the battery.Do a Deep CleanGadgets need regular cleaning. Dirt and debris clogging up our equipment can contribute to overheating, which shortens the life of our electronics.So Mr. Wiens recommended this regular cleaning routine:For mobile devices, look inside the ports. Dust and food crumbs easily get lodged inside the charging ports, which causes the phone to charge more slowly. Shine a flashlight into the port for a close look. Use canned aerosol or a sewing needle to remove any debris.For computers, blow out the fans once a year. Opening up the case of a laptop or desktop machine reveals its fans. The fans accumulate lots of dust and hair over time, and the dirtier the fans are, the hotter your device gets. Take a small vacuum cleaner or a can of aerosol to get rid of the gunk.Declutter Your DataThe more device storage you use up, the slower a gadget gets. So set a calendar reminder to do a data purge at least once a year.On iPhones, Apple offers the tool iPhone Storage, which shows a list of apps that take up the most data and when they were last used; on Android devices, Google offers a similar tool called Files. Use these tools to delete any apps that you haven\u2019t touched in more than six months.To do a quick purge with computers, open a folder and sort the files by when they were last opened. From there, you can immediately eliminate files and apps you have not opened in years.If purging files is too cumbersome, there are shortcuts. Some Android phones have a slot for inserting a memory card, where you can load games and videos. Similarly, with computers you can plug in an external hard drive and store large files there. That will free up storage on the device so that the operating system runs faster, said Vincent Lai, director of the Fixers Collective, a social club in New York that repairs aging devices to extend their lives.Protect Your GearMost smartphone owners already know to wear cases to protect their devices from drops. That\u2019s wise \u2014 a good case protects your phone from scratches and absorbs impact in the corners, edges and the back of your device. Carrying a phone without a case is similar to driving a car without bumpers.Especially if you\u2019re accident prone, a screen protector is another safeguard. Small scratches on a screen can weaken the glass, increasing the likelihood for it to shatter the next time it\u2019s dropped. Wirecutter, a New York Times site that tests products, recommends protectors from Maxboost and TechMatte, which cost $8 to $14.Find a FixerIf any of the above intimidates you, there are plenty of professionals who can help.A few weeks ago, I opened my iPhone camera app and noticed something odd: The image was shaky even though my hand was still. I concluded something had gone wrong with the hardware.So I went on Yelp and searched \u201ciPhone repair.\u201d The site loaded a tool for getting quotes from multiple fixers in my area. About a dozen repair shops all responded within a day, and I was surprised by how widely their responses varied. Some quoted $80 to $100 and said the repair would take one or two hours. Others said the job could take up to two days and cost $140 to $180.To cross-reference, I checked iFixit\u2019s guide on replacing an iPhone camera, which said the repair should take about an hour and the part could cost $120.The response from Shakeel the iPhone Repair Guy, Mr. Taiyab\u2019s shop, was the most terse: \u201cI know exactly what\u2019s wrong with your camera. Please bring it by \u2014 I can fix your phone within five minutes.\u201d His quote was $80.His repair shop had more than 1,000 Yelp reviews with an average of five stars. I scanned them and saw no warning signs of fakes. Above all, I liked the confidence in his response.I drove to his shop. There, Mr. Taiyab quickly opened up my phone with a screwdriver and said a moving part inside the camera, which controls the optical zoom, had broken \u2014 possibly from a drop \u2014 so the camera module had to be replaced. True to his word, he replaced it in a few minutes and charged $80. My photos now look as clear as they did when the phone was brand-new.The lessons? When collecting quotes, pay attention to the price and customer reviews, and do a web search on the repair to get a realistic idea of the true cost and difficulty of the task. (Just because a repair shop says it will take longer doesn\u2019t mean it will do a better job.)The most important lesson: When you find a good gadget repair shop, reward it with your loyalty. I took my wife\u2019s seven-year-old MacBook Pro to Mr. Taiyab\u2019s this week to replace the battery. It took him 15 minutes and cost $140 \u2014 time and money well spent for a computer that should last us many years to come."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/personaltech/family-history-genealogy-online.html", "title": "How to Dig Up Family History Online", "summary": "Digitized newspaper archives and hyperlocal historical sources can help you understand how your ancestors lived.", "authors": "By J. D. Biersdorfer", "text": "Long before the internet made it easy to share the nuances of daily life, local newspapers and other regional publications reported the business, society and civic news of the people in the community. For budding genealogists, finding an ancestor in an old microfilmed newspaper and reading contemporaneous accounts of her turn in the school play or his all-city bowling championship provide a glimpse into the past that\u2019s more textured than a chart of names and dates.Taking a more narrative approach to the family story can be a time-consuming detective project with no guaranteed results. But once you have a name and know when and where the person lived, you can start your quest to find out how they lived. Here\u2019s how to get started.Digging Up Your RootsIf you\u2019re just beginning to climb your family tree and need names on the branches, a subscription service like Ancestry or MyHeritage can be an easy place to start gathering information. In addition to billions of digitized records (like census data, draft rolls and religious registries), these services include tutorials, articles, message boards and other tools to help learn you learn how to find your people.ImageLarge subscription genealogy services like Ancestry host billions of historical records from the National Archives and elsewhere that you can search.Credit...The New York TimesWhen you get some names pinned to your tree, you may also start to receive hints of possible undiscovered relatives from the site\u2019s algorithms or the service\u2019s other members to help you along. If you\u2019re not sure you want to commit to a regular subscription fee, look for a free trial period.Finding Alternative ResourcesSleuthing on a budget? Visit the National Archives site and its \u201cResources for Genealogists\u201d page for links to information on finding land records, immigration and naturalization documents, census data, military-service papers, and more. While not all government records may be free or digitized, the National Archives hosts a page of links from other genealogy sites where you can look for information.ImageThe National Archives site has a huge collection of resources for people researching their family\u2019s history in the United States.Credit...The New York TimesSome ancestors are harder to trace than others. For families severed by slavery or overlooked by government, the site has an Ethnic Heritage section with tips for finding African-American ancestors, as well as for those searching for Chinese, Hispanic/Latino, Japanese or Native American forebears.FamilySearch, run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, requires only a free account to search its billions of historical records. Geni.com (owned by MyHeritage) has free basic family-tree building services and a large social community that encourages members to work together. Immigration museums may also have free online databases, like the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Passenger Search.Diving Into the ArchivesOnce you have pinned your ancestors to specific places and years, look for local media from that time. Business dealings, town government activity, social gatherings and obituaries were often reported in 19th- and 20th-century papers. But be warned: In addition to sometimes florid writing, articles from certain eras and areas can be rife with the unchecked misogyny, racism and xenophobia of the day.The Newspaper Archives, Indexes and Morgues section of the Library of Congress site has links to many digitized publications, including African-American, Cherokee and Mexican-American newspapers.The Ancestor Hunt genealogy site has a section devoted to finding historical newspapers online, and the Elephind site lets you search a growing collection of digitized international newspapers. Some archives are free, some charge to view the microfilmed images, and search capabilities vary.ImageThe search function of Newspapers.com can help you find your ancestors in the archive and on the digitized copy of printed page.Credit...The New York TimesNewspapers.com is an archive with more than 17,000 digitized publications dating from the 1700s.

(Some libraries also offer free access to the commercial genealogy services.)ImageIf your family has been tied to an area for generations, you may be able to find your forebears in a local history book that has been digitized by Google or an independent archivist.Credit...The New York TimesAs settlements grew, local historians often wrote books that chronicled that development and its founding families. Many of these volumes are now digitized in the public domain; search Google Books or the Internet Archive for the town or county in question.Your relatives may also appear in the vital records bureaus of the states where they lived. The RootsWeb site offers tips on searching in its Red Book collection of American state, county and town resources.ImageEven if you can't visit the cemetery, a search on the Find a Grave site might lead you right to a relative's plot.Credit...The New York TimesAnd finally, if burial was the family tradition, try the Find a Grave site, a searchable database of cemeteries; like Newspapers.com, it\u2019s owned by Ancestry.

Two Times reporters debate the answer.", "authors": "By Mike Isaac and Conor Dougherty", "text": "Hardcore gamers and post-apocalyptica enthusiasts have waited years for a sequel to The Last of Us, an immersive video game set in a dark, dismal future after a fungus ravaged Earth and zombies have become the ruling class. The game unspooled through the lens of two unlikely companions: a hardened, Texan smuggler named Joel and a 14-year-old, streetwise girl named Ellie.The Last of Us Part II hits stores on Friday, when the studio Naughty Dog releases what is a winding, punishing follow-up that explores even more complex ideas and a richer character universe.Mike Isaac and Conor Dougherty, two New York Times reporters, spent weeks playing the game in the run up to release. They discussed their first impressions of the game.Mike: Let me start with something simple. I\u2019m a huge fan of the first game, which I thought was perfect as a stand-alone piece. The story was compelling, and the depth of the characters and their evolving relationships really felt about as powerful to me as any other part of the game. I enjoyed the narrative far beyond the shoot em\u2019 up zombie killing.So I was a bit worried when I saw the sequel was coming, and that the game studio might be messing up a good thing. But after what felt like dozens of emotional, gut-wrenching hours playing Part II, I\u2019m glad they followed up.Character relationships have become richer, the game\u2019s universe has expanded, and more complicated questions around morality, tribalism and vengeance are being asked of the characters \u2014 and of ourselves.I left the game wiped, emotionally. But I do feel like it enriched my idea of what video games should be. I read your review and really dug it. But would you consider this game \u201cfun?\u201dImageA scene from The Last of Us Part II.Credit...SonyConor: If you find this fun in the traditional sense, you\u2019re twisted. But sad movies aren\u2019t fun either, and I found the game interesting and worthwhile in that it told an effective story and expanded my sense of what big-budget games can do.Mike: Yeah, that\u2019s fair. I won\u2019t go too heavily into spoilers, but I appreciated some of the risks the studio decided to take here right from the get-go.The way they are willing to kill off characters made me feel a sense of, I don\u2019t know, unease? Like the world they inhabit is actually dangerous, and that no one is really safe. Kind of like what an actual zombie apocalypse might look like.I know you loved the first one. What struck you as the most novel thing about the sequel?Conor: How emotional it made me. At the end I was scared to finish because I was so worried what Ellie might do, and that\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve never had in a game. It left me sad and exhausted, as you say, but you have to marvel at the storytelling.Mike: Agreed. It was a feeling few games really give me, which is why it felt like more than a game? I made the allusion to an interactive film, given the numerous cut-scenes and story development cinematics.One thing that really stuck with me was the level of detail and care they put into hammering home the points they were trying to make. In most games, for instance, murder costs nothing, and is often largely the point of playing. Take Call of Duty or some other shooter game where your goal is to just ratchet up the highest body count.I\u2019m not saying killing in this game isn\u2019t part of it. But each death takes an emotional toll on the character and, I would argue, on the player. They do this thing where when you kill a random enemy, one of their allies might cry out \u201cSteve!\u201d or \u201cJill!\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s subtle, but gives an entire back story to someone that in other games might just be any old NPC (non-player character). And all it took was a name.Conor: That dog, man. That dog.Mike: Ugh. That tore me up. And you know how I am with dogs.Conor: That\u2019s the riskiest thing this game does \u2014 it makes you feel gross playing it.In the first game you kill things in defense of a child, which made me feel OK about all the gore. With this new one \u2014 again, no spoilers \u2014 it\u2019s less about working toward a satisfying ending than it is seeing how someone else reacts to an event whose outcome you already know.The surprises are surprises of character and perspective, and I thought that was deep. Did you find yourself changing your feelings toward the Abby character, who you\u2019re supposed to hate at the beginning and feel more mixed about at the end?Mike: Yeah, totally. I was impressed with the way they were able to flip my feelings on their head, from the starting point of the story to the ending.My one big criticism of the game is its length; at points it felt interminable, and I almost found myself wanting the game to end precisely because it was a long slog of brutal violence and gore.ImageThe game has a rich character universe.Credit...Brian Finke for The New York TimesBut the flip side of that is what they were able to accomplish with character development. We had already spent an entire game with the Ellie character in Part 1. I think, to some degree, we needed just as much time with Abby to really connect with her. And I think we did.Conor: And that\u2019s what makes these games so amazing: You spend so much time with these characters and unlike movies get to inhabit them, so the story unfolds in a way that feels really authentic, assuming you can handle the zombie killing.

The best in the world is a big statement, but sure. Gracias, Abuelita. Watch out, Denzel. Abuelita didn\u2019t know the rules. Mission No. 1 in L.A., go unnoticed, sort of. Blend in, not too edgy, and too soft. Be you, if you are something we all see you as \u2014 make sense? It\u2019s tough. Be the best and stand out while blending in, got it? It takes time, practice, and thick skin, but not too thick or too dark, OK? Signed, Hollywood. Man, you\u2019ve come a long way, Chris, Since that acting school big thick-ass Dominican \u2018fro you used to rock. Calm your curls, Rivas, calm your curls, Rivas, calm your curls. There\u2019s a conversation you don\u2019t want to have anymore. You\u2019ve been sitting in this chair for six years calming these curls so you can look like something classic and unidentifiable. Mr. Rivas, have a seat and listen up. Now, your job, as a man of color, isn\u2019t to stand out, but to fit in, to fit the roles they want you to play. And you have fit in. You have done a real good job of fitting in. Congrats, Rivas, on a life of blending in in response to the stories and heroes on TV played by the white boys who don\u2019t look like you. Their hair don\u2019t curl the same way. But you too want to tell these stories. And so you chop. You get a cut that says, yeah, I can fit into your boxes. For who do I want to look this way? Do I really want to kick it on fake stoops in fake urban cities on fake landscapes with a bunch of brown people with crew cuts? Will I get everything I ever wanted, only to realize it is a nightmare to be seen by eyes that don\u2019t actually see you? In jungles, you find your pack. In prison, you find the ones who will protect you. In Hollywood, if you look as ethnically ambiguous as you, and you want to play the game, then you\u2019ve got to know the rules, their rules, and you\u2019ve got to play the part. And that means code switching, and staying out of the sun, and keeping your thick curls at bay, because it\u2019s all a part of survival. That\u2019s it, huh? Survival? That\u2019s grim. That\u2019s bleak, Rivas. Montages of false people, people of color, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s not our friends, it\u2019s not our family, it\u2019s not the people we love, so who cares?

A 2019 report looked at 100 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2018 and found that only 3 percent of the lead or colead roles went to Latinos (and a similar study found only 27 percent of the top 100 movies in 2018 had leads or coleads of color).

Trump Knew What Russia Was Doing.", "summary": "Neglecting aggression by Vladimir Putin inevitably invites more of it.", "authors": "By Douglas London", "text": "Did President Trump know about U.S. intelligence community assessments that the Russians had offered bounties to the Taliban for attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan? He hasn\u2019t so far offered a direct answer but instead shifting, manipulative responses.That is itself troubling. It is also troubling that he has not condemned even the possibility of such Russian aggression.But let\u2019s step back and set aside the question of Russian bounties for a moment. For years, Russia has provided material and financial assistance to the Taliban, with what was surely the intent of supporting attacks against troops from the United States and coalition forces. Was the president aware of that?I can answer that question: Yes, he was most certainly aware of Russian assistance to the Taliban. Despite that knowledge, he chose to do nothing.From 2016 to 2018, I was the C.I.A.\u2019s chief for counterterrorism in south and southwest Asia, overseeing operations and intelligence concerning Afghanistan, which included related activities of regional actors, like Russia.\u201cBounty\u201d is not a term intelligence professionals would likely use. Intelligence reporting requires precision in language to guard against the risk of misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and \u201cbounty\u201d lacks specificity in meaning, purpose and consequence. Intelligence professionals speak with dry, clinical facts and assessments that are not \u201cconfirmed\u201d or \u201cverified,\u201d but rather corroborated to various degrees of confidence.The goal is to provide the president with information on developments that may significantly affect U.S. interests. With this information, the president and his team can take any necessary action against potential threats. The government can\u2019t wait for complete certainty; by then it would be too late to do anything about it.It can therefore be semantically true that the president never received a briefing on Russian \u201cbounties\u201d \u2014 that specific word may not have been uttered. But the White House does not deny news reports that the President\u2019s Daily Brief on Feb. 27 included information from our intelligence agencies in clinical terms that Russians were offering financial incentives to encourage Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition troops.Now, the Russians would not provide the Taliban blank checks. The continuation and expansion of their assistance would have required that the Taliban provide evidence \u2014 videos proving that they used Russian arms and financing to attack U.S. and coalition targets. Intelligence services use this common practice to verify the investments in proxy groups, as well as to make sure they are productive and aligned with their goals. Even the Russian military intelligence agency, widely known as the G.R.U., has auditors who need to ensure that funds expensed are used as intended.But in short, American intelligence agencies reported that the Russians were offering bounties \u2014\u00a0even if they were called \u201cpayments\u201d in briefings.The Russian bounties look like an escalation of that earlier Russian support for the Taliban \u2014 support that was publicly commented on by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 and by the commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, in 2018.At a 2017 news conference, when asked whether he was refuting that Russia was sending weapons to the Taliban, General Nicholson responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not refuting that.\u201dSecretary Mattis received the President\u2019s Daily Briefs that Mr. Trump did. General Nicholson read both strategic- and tactical-level reporting about Afghanistan, including the actions of Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan and India that might affect military and political circumstances on the ground. There is nothing inaccurate in the observations from Generals Mattis and Nicholson. The president must have known all this, too.There is also substantial evidence concerning Pakistan\u2019s and Iran\u2019s support for Taliban efforts to target U.S. troops. In a recent report, the State Department judged that Pakistan continued to serve as a terrorist haven and allowed the Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani network to operate from its territory.Iranian support to the Taliban reportedly included lethal aid and training under the direction of Esmail Ghaani, the Iranian general who later took over command of the Quds Force, the foreign expeditionary arm of the Revolutionary Guards, after America\u2019s targeted killing of Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Iran\u2019s Shiite leadership is not an ideological ally of the Sunni Taliban, but as Russia does, it looks for opportunities to hasten America\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan, increase influence with the Taliban and make the United States pay a price for a military presence so near its borders.The Iranian and Pakistani support probably did more to endanger Americans and Afghans than Russian aid did. So the president was right to support efforts to address, within practical limits, evidence of Pakistani and Iranian behavior affecting the security of Americans.Yet Mr. Trump took no action against Moscow. He could have signaled discontent with Russia diplomatically, economically or through back-channel intelligence conduits. Instead, to make matters worse, he pressured the U.S. intelligence community to invest time and resources in potential counterterrorist cooperation. It backfired: Russia was not forthcoming and sought to manipulate the engagement to influence policymakers and target Russian dissidents.As any observer of Russia knows, neglecting aggression inevitably invites more of it \u2014 to expand Russian influence and power at American expense. For examples, look at Ukraine, Syria and increasingly Libya, Africa and even Europe.In Afghanistan, the aggression apparently took the form of more audacious Russian behavior like bounties.We cannot ignore the bigger picture of America\u2019s Afghanistan policy. Within days of receiving the Feb. 27 daily brief addressing Russian bounties, Mr. Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to oversee an agreement with the Taliban for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan \u2014 despite the Taliban\u2019s kidnapping just weeks earlier of an American civil engineer and government contractor, Mark Frerichs. In May, the United Nations Security Council shared information \u2014 reaffirmed by our own intelligence in a Pentagon report dated July 1 \u2014 concerning close and continuing cooperation between the Taliban and Al Qaeda.Even the leader of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, told the Middle East Institute on June 10 that the Taliban had yet to meet conditions concerning its cooperation and relationship with Al Qaeda to merit the U.S. withdrawal.Clearly, regardless of the facts on the ground or the intelligence about Russia and Al Qaeda, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo remain determined to see through their agreement with the Taliban and likewise make it appear a success.It is easy to get lost in the fog of Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing and calculated war of denial and deception. But this much is plain: He has still, despite weeks of public debate over Russian bounties, not offered a clear and unambiguous condemnation of such Russian aggression.It\u2019s imperative that he be held accountable. The president must explain to the American people, and especially to those who risk their lives for their country and our families, why he continues to abide Russian threats to our troops, our security and our democracy.Douglas London (@Douglaslondon5) was a senior operations officer in the C.I.A.

This is dangerous for many reasons \u2014 but for women, it\u2019s devastating. They would be stripped of the protections they have had in the decade since passage of the law, known as Obamacare.Before the law, insurance companies routinely discriminated against women. Those who didn\u2019t work for employers with affordable health insurance or who weren\u2019t old enough or poor enough to qualify for Medicare or Medicaid struggled to buy health insurance in the individual market, where insurance companies made all the rules.In those days, insurers could charge women up to two or three times more than men for identical health policies. Women discovered that many of the services and medicines they needed were not even covered, like coverage for pregnancy, which was not included in most individual policies and was impossible to purchase once a woman became pregnant.Insurance companies routinely denied coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions, a practice that affects more women than men. About 30 million women have a pre-existing condition \u2014 like side effects from having taken Accutane as a teenager, depression or breast cancer \u2014 compared with about 24 million men, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Obamacare put an end to that gender discrimination. Women young and old, working in jobs or at home, gained coverage and health benefits that they never had before. Insurance companies were required to sell policies to women with pre-existing conditions and had to stop kicking them off their health plans if they got sick. And all health insurance policies had to include maternity coverage.As the Affordable Care Act was being drawn up, Congress asked an expert panel of doctors and scientists to identify health services used by women that were missing from most health policies. As a result, the law required that women\u2019s preventive services like depression screening, breast pumps for nursing mothers, various cancer screenings, well-woman visits and all methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration were included free in health plans. Over 50 million women got access to no-cost birth control, which has helped to reduce teen pregnancies and abortions in the United States to record lows.But the Trump administration has worked hard to limit birth control benefits, and last week the Supreme Court upheld a Trump administration rule allowing employers with moral or religious objections to opt out of the Obamacare mandate to provide no-cost contraceptive services for women.Other coverage made possible by Obamacare would also disappear if the Supreme Court overturns the law.Before Obamacare, while federal rules mandated coverage for all pregnant women up to 60 days after delivery, state income thresholds then often terminated health insurance for new mothers. Now in the 37 states that have expanded Medicaid, Obamacare provides for continuing coverage for new mothers with low incomes. Low-income working women without children, like nurses\u2019 aides and service workers, who often were not entitled to any Medicaid coverage based on income, now have access to low-cost health insurance in those states.Women under the age of 26, whether they were married or single or had children, became eligible to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans. Women over 65, enrolled in Medicare, had annual well-woman visits added to their benefits. And for those who take a lot of medications, their prescription drug costs were greatly reduced.With the Covid-19 economic crash, many women with employer-sponsored health insurance are losing their coverage along with their jobs. But thanks to Obamacare, many unemployed workers qualify for Medicaid or for subsidized insurance, so women can continue to have health coverage as the economy recovers.If President Trump wins his case to eliminate Obamacare, millions of women could lose coverage because of a pre-existing health condition, access to expanded Medicaid insurance and no-cost contraception and other preventive health services.Women who own their own businesses or work in the gig economy could no longer rely on federal help in buying health insurance for themselves and their families. And once again, insurance companies could limit health benefits that women need and charge them more than men for their health care.Women in America should make no mistake.

Blow", "text": "I think I echo many Americans, and people of the world in general, when I say that I\u2019m having a hard time fully grappling with the gravity of this moment.It is still hard to absorb that a virus has reshaped world behavior, halted or altered travel, strained the economy and completely reshaped the nature of public spaces and human interaction.It is also hard to absorb that this may not be a quickly passing phase, an inconvenience for a season, but something that the world is forced to live with for years, even assuming that a vaccine is soon found.There\u2019s this notion that things could turn on a dime, not because of a human action, but rather because humans are under attack.The idea that years of planning for graduations and weddings, home purchases and retirement, might all come to a screeching halt is humbling and disorienting. The confusion over how and when children can safely return to school and adults can safely return to work is frustrating because it leaves people\u2019s lives in the lurch.The idea that face coverings and elbow bumps may be the new normal is a shock to the system.It seems that on multiple levels, society is being tested, and often failing.People are rebelling against isolation, and against science and public health. They want the old world back, the pre-Covid-19 world back, but it cannot be had. The virus doesn\u2019t feel frustration or react to it. It\u2019s not aware of your children or your job or your vacation plans. It\u2019s not aware of our politics.The virus is a virus, mindless, and in this case, incredibly efficient and effective. It will pass from person to person for as long as that is possible. The political debate over mask wearing is a human concern, one that works to the virus\u2019s benefit.And it is these politics, particularly as articulated by Donald Trump, that are allowing the virus to ravage this nation and steal tens of thousands of lives that should not have been stolen.It is Trump\u2019s politicization of the virus that has resulted in a new surge of cases in this country when many other developed nations have been able to shrink the number of cases among their people.It is because of Donald Trump that America has now reported 3.2 million cases and has tallied nearly 135,000 deaths.But, instead of centering on the sick, dying and dead as the true victims of his malfeasance, Trump casts himself as the victim of circumstances. As The Washington Post reported last week, Trump has adopted a woe-is-me attitude with visitors. As the paper put it:\u201cTrump often launches into a monologue placing himself at the center of the nation\u2019s turmoil. The president has cast himself in the starring role of the blameless victim \u2014 of a deadly pandemic, of a stalled economy, of deep-seated racial unrest, all of which happened to him rather than the country.\u201dHow are we supposed to comprehend this idea that the president is eschewing that responsibility for political purposes, and in the process, putting untold American lives in danger and actually costing some?How did it come to such a pass that scientists and experts could be hamstrung, that governors and mayors could be bullied, that millions of Americans could risk their own well-being and the well-being of others to make a political point?This is the America we are all now navigating.We\u2019ve witnessed scene after scene of minimum-wage workers in conflict with customers \u2014\u00a0many no doubt who came in search of conflict, in search of a stage on which to perform their drama of defiance \u2014\u00a0who refuse to wear masks inside stores.Part of the issue is that the virus is not only being politicized, its effects are also racialized: Black and brown people are having worse outcomes. Some of the states now seeing the greatest surges in cases are those in the South and West with large Black or Hispanic populations.The effects of the disease are also ageist: Older people are more likely to die from it. Florida not only has a large Hispanic population, it also has a large population of retirees.I believe that these variances add to the political callousness America is seeing: If the disease is seen as disproportionately hurting others \u2014 a Boomer killer, or a Black \u201cBrotha\u201d killer, or an abuela killer \u2014 then some younger, healthier white people might believe that the threat to themselves is lower and the restrictions on them should be looser.We have a situation in this country where a disease is spiraling out of control, largely because of the president himself, and there is little sign or hope that it will be constrained soon.We are living in a horror film, one starring Donald Trump.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

And Joe and Bernie coming together on proposals is not plagiarism.As to Kinnock, Kellyanne, I know a little something about that. That was my front-page Times story back in 1987. Biden, as he did on other occasions, got swept away with puffing himself up and sprinted over the factual line. He overidentified with aspects of Kinnock\u2019s life in Wales \u2014 fusing their backgrounds \u2014 and borrowed some Celtic lyricism.I wrote another story at the same time about Biden lifting chunks of Robert Kennedy speeches. But that was the fault of his speechwriter Pat Caddell, who sprinkled in R.F.K. passages without Biden knowing.Biden dropped out of the race. I ran into him on a back stairway in the Senate when he was getting ready for his news conference. We looked at each other but did not speak. I figured he\u2019d never speak to me again.I was wrong. One of his top aides yelled at me and told me I wouldn\u2019t be allowed into Robert Bork\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which Biden was chairing. But Biden himself was friendly and fair to me afterward, even when I wrote pieces that were highly critical of the way he conducted the Anita Hill hearings and ripped on him for his hair plugs. He was so un-vengeful that I began to doubt he was really Irish. (His middle name is Robinette, after all.)Biden has a talent for messes and has made some bad judgment calls \u2014 including voting to authorize the Iraq war.But when David Axelrod told me that Barack Obama was leaning toward putting Biden on the ticket, I thought it was a fine idea. I felt that Obama made a mistake nudging him aside in 2016 \u2014 I think he would have beaten Trump.Biden\u2019s gaffes, logorrhea, puffery and handsiness are part of the messy package that is Uncle Joe. So are his empathy, sentimentality and loyalty.Biden\u2019s fabulist flights were an effort to make himself look better. Trump\u2019s are more audacious \u2014 and dangerous. It\u2019s the difference between fibs and whoppers, white lies and white supremacy.Every day, Trump wakes up and constructs an alternative universe where his crowds are bigger, his poll results are better, the virus is evaporating, the testing is fantastic, it\u2019s totally safe for kids to go back to school, and he\u2019s doing the greatest job of any president in history.\u201cToxic positivity,\u201d the president\u2019s niece Mary Trump calls it in her new family memoir, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough,\u201d which exposes the gruesome underbelly of the president\u2019s gilded facade.Mary Trump is the daughter of the president\u2019s older brother, Fred Jr., who died an alcoholic after a lifetime of his father\u2019s abuse.

Here\u2019s your chance.", "authors": "By Jennifer Senior", "text": "Over the last few weeks, America\u2019s elite colleges and universities have been announcing their reopening strategies one by one, weighing explicit health imperatives against implicit economic ones. Most have landed on a disappointing-but-realistic conclusion: The fall semester of 2020 will have to involve an alloy of in-person and remote learning. Many college students will experience only an attenuated version of campus life \u2014 if they get to experience it at all.It\u2019s easy to see what they will lose in this situation. The intoxicating pleasures of independence. The stimulation of late-night conversation about life, meaning, and the universe. The pure exhilaration (and relief) of finding your own kind.But let\u2019s face it: It\u2019s pretty luxurious to have these experiences in the first place. Perhaps it\u2019s worth discussing what these luckiest of students might also gain at this moment. Because they do stand to gain. It just requires that they reimagine what late adolescence is for, and what it should be about.The fact is, many colleges \u2014 especially private liberal arts schools, the ones that have driven much of the discussion in recent weeks \u2014 are cloistered, passive settings. Students are fed and housed, just as they were at home; their time and activities are structured, just as it was when they were still in high school. College may give them wonderful opportunities to think, form relationships, and self-define. But it seldom gives them the chance to productively engage with the world.Yet they are more than capable of doing so. In \u201cHuck\u2019s Raft,\u201d his highly readable history of American childhood, Steven Mintz points out that Herman Melville worked as a clerk, a teacher, a farmer laborer and a cabin boy on a whaling ship, all by the age of 20. (\u201cA whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard,\u201d says Ishmael.) George Washington became an official surveyor for Culpepper County at 17 and a commissioned major in the militia at 20.\u201cBehavior that we would consider precocious,\u201d Mintz writes, \u201cwas commonplace.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until the end of World War II that children emerged as a truly protected class in this country. That was when they finally became, in the words of the sociologist Viviana Zelizer, \u201ceconomically worthless but emotionally priceless.\u201dBut only the most privileged kids got to be useless right through college. If you think about it, that\u2019s a pretty awkward time to be useless \u2014 as is adolescence more generally. We may regard teenagers as unruly and rebellious. But what they may really be is restless, pining for greater agency and productivity, utility.Well. Now they have their chance.I called Nancy Darling, a psychology professor at Oberlin College, to discuss this. She\u2019s one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever read on the subject of adolescence and emerging adulthood. Her response was swift and enthusiastic. \u201cI keep telling my students: \u2018This is the defining event of your cohort. It\u2019s going to be hard, but it offers unique opportunities. Rather than doing a crummy internship while you\u2019re learning from home, go do something exciting! What do you want to build?\u2019 \u201dStudents of means can distribute food from food banks. They can mobilize voters. They can organize social media campaigns for advocacy groups and child care for essential workers and reading lists for libraries. \u201cIf you\u2019re a volunteer for six months,\u201d she points out, \u201cin many places you can just take over the damn organization.\u201dThey can help remove Donald J. Trump from office. There\u2019s an idea.Darling notes that finding a way to be useful will be especially valuable (if challenging) to this generation, which hasn\u2019t had much experience in structuring its own time \u2014 many of her students have been overscheduled since birth \u2014 and often conceives of identity-building as a process of self-examination, rather than simple doing. They\u2019ll also have a chance to discover the importance of civic engagement at a time when it\u2019s in severe decline.The irony is lovely: While social distancing, they can develop habits that will ensure they won\u2019t spend their adulthood bowling alone, to borrow the political scientist Robert Putnam\u2019s shorthand for our disengaged lives.Of course, most students already know what it means to be useful. A 2018 report from Georgetown University found that 70 percent of full-time college students work. Those in community college, for instance, are generally older and come from low-income homes. Many take for granted that they\u2019ll be organizing their educations around work and parenting schedules. One can only hope that asynchronous learning will to them be a boon. It\u2019s much easier to care for your kids and hold down a day job if you\u2019re liberated from the tyranny of a fixed lecture schedule.But that assumes they can afford the technology and have internet access. Many students, at community colleges and elsewhere, now do not. Others find themselves in households with one or two unemployed family members, and it\u2019s suddenly on them to make ends meet \u2014which may or may not mean dropping out. It\u2019s a burden that, like so many others right now, is disproportionately afflicting African-Americans and Latinos.Having the chance to be useful \u2014 not to their families, but to the world \u2014 is a luxury at this moment. Students ought to embrace it. They may be astonished by what they find.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

But he might persuade Americans that democracy just does not work.", "authors": "By Eric Posner", "text": "Back when Donald Trump was running for president in 2016, Republican leaders claimed to believe that, as president, Mr. Trump would respect the rule of law. \u201cI still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,\u201d Senator John McCain said. \u201cWe have a Congress. We have the Supreme Court. We\u2019re not Romania.\u201dRomania is looking pretty good these days. Freedom House, an organization that monitors political freedoms in countries around the world, has downgraded the United States to a score of 86 out of 100, just three points higher than Romania, and far below America\u2019s erstwhile democratic peers like Britain and Germany. (The United States received a score of 94 in 2010.) Mr. Trump has both benefited from, and contributed to, this alarming decline.But to give Mr. McCain his due, the president has not yet in a clear sense violated the laws or Constitution of the United States. He has blustered and threatened to break the law but always pulled back at the last minute in the most important cases. The president\u2019s damage to the country has come through his poisoning of the public discourse with lies and insults; his efforts, largely unsuccessful, to direct criminal investigations against his enemies; his politically motivated manipulation of his office to enhance his standing at the expense of American foreign policy and the broader public interest; his appointment of hacks to high positions in government; and his terrible policy choices, including his neglect of the coronavirus pandemic. All of this was legal, alas, with the ambiguous exception of his (mostly unsuccessful) obstruction of criminal investigations of his aides.All of which raises the question: What will happen if Mr. Trump is re-elected? John Bolton, hardly a member of the \u201cResistance,\u201d has called his former boss a \u201cdanger for the republic\u201d if re-elected. Will Mr. Trump in a second term finally burst the bounds of the Constitution as so many critics have predicted since he entered office in 2017?The answer is most likely no, and for two reasons. First, American institutions, while damaged, remain robust. They have mostly pushed back when Mr. Trump tried to push them aside. The courts have frequently ruled against, and even condemned, Mr. Trump. The press has been unfazed by Mr. Trump\u2019s harassment of journalists. The states ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s orders to lift their Covid-19 lockdowns or to suppress protests against police brutality. The military balked when Mr. Trump threatened to send personnel against protesters. While wobbly, the Justice Department has mostly followed through on investigations of Trump allies \u2014 with the withdrawal of the prosecution of Michael Flynn a rare exception.Second, and surprisingly for some, Mr. Trump has not tried to expand his powers. There is a long history in other countries of democratically elected leaders seizing dictatorial powers in an emergency, and Mr. Trump\u2019s critics expected the same from him. But when an authentic crisis struck the United States in the form of the pandemic, Mr. Trump was conspicuously uninterested in seizing power or even using the powers he already possessed. By contrast, Viktor Orban, the leader of Hungary, followed the demagogue\u2019s playbook by demanding and obtaining near-dictatorial powers from the legislature.The brute political fact that distinguishes Mr. Trump and Mr. Orban is that Mr. Trump is exceedingly unpopular and widely distrusted \u2014 and has been since his election in 2016. He lacks political support for any authoritarian ambitions he may harbor. Americans, with a long if fraying tradition of democracy that countries like Hungary lack, still seem uninterested in a king.All this is not to argue for complacency in case the president is re-elected but to suggest that we focus on the damage that Mr. Trump is likely to do rather than worst-case scenarios that are unlikely to occur.As long as Republicans remain in power in the Senate, Mr. Trump will continue to have a free hand to appoint loyalists like Attorney General Bill Barr, who has increasingly shielded Mr. Trump and his allies from investigations and prosecution. Angered by adverse rulings by Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump will probably seek to appoint a lackey if a vacancy opens up.Mr. Trump has compiled an astonishing record of failure for his regulatory agencies \u2014 according to one count, courts have blocked agency actions (including deregulatory actions craved by Mr. Trump\u2019s business allies) almost 90 percent of the time. We can expect further mismanagement of U.S. agencies during a second term. Many civil servants are demoralized by the administration\u2019s hostility to regulation; others resent political pressure from above. Many of these people, who represent a deep well of expertise on everything from nuclear power to epidemiology, may quit rather than endure four more years of contempt and harassment.Mr. Trump has used many legal resources at his disposal to block foreigners from working and taking refuge in the United States and to disrupt foreign trade. Expect more of the same, with further damage to America\u2019s economy and its relationships with its allies.Expect Mr. Trump to continue to abuse the presidency\u2019s powers over foreign affairs to the detriment of American foreign policy. Mr. Trump may finally indulge his impulse to withdraw the United States from NATO. Disgusted with Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for cozying up to dictators and offering concessions in return for support for his electoral interests, Western democracies will continue to distance themselves from the United States. Unconstrained by the prospect of electoral backlash, Mr. Trump will use his pardon power even more flagrantly than he already has to reward political allies who broke the law.At the same time, if Mr. Trump remains unpopular even after winning re-election, it seems likely that the courts, the agencies and Congress will continue to hem him in, preventing him from acting forcefully even when he should. A weakened presidency, whoever occupies the office, will be unable to address significant domestic problems \u2014 including the continuing risks from the pandemic and the growing unease about policing \u2014 and will embolden dangerous foes, from Russia to Iran.If Donald Trump is a danger to democracy, it is not because he will overthrow the Constitution. It is because his contempt for American values and institutions, and his ineptitude as a leader, may persuade Americans, by his example if nothing else, that democracy just does not work. While we still seem to be a long way from that point, four more years of Mr. Trump will bring us that much closer.Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and author of, most recently, \u201cThe Demagogue\u2019s Playbook: The Battle for American Democracy From the Founders to Trump.\u201dThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Better options are not hard to find.", "authors": "By The Editorial Board", "text": "African-Americans were nonpersons in the eyes of the state when the federal government started to name U.S. Army installations for Confederate officers. Black people in the South were being lynched with impunity for such offenses as seeking the vote, competing with white people in business or simply failing to give way on the sidewalk.In Washington, Woodrow Wilson styled the government itself as an instrument of white supremacy. His administration segregated the federal work force, and decimated the Black middle class by purging African-Americans from well-paying supervisory positions in which they had sometimes managed white subordinates.In a process that began under the Wilson administration in 1917, 10 Southern military installations were eventually named for the same Confederate officers who had waged war on the United States with the goal of preserving and expanding slavery.Among those whose names fly over Southern Army bases to this day are Henry Lewis Benning, a principal architect of secession who argued that Black Americans were suited only for enslavement; the Georgia Ku Klux Klan leader John Brown Gordon, who helped the Klan establish itself as a cohesive entity; Robert E. Lee, a central figure in the war of rebellion whose army kidnapped free African-Americans for sale into slavery; and the war criminal George Pickett, who fled to Canada to escape possible prosecution for wrongfully executing Union soldiers.Wilson\u2019s embrace of the Confederacy disserved history in ways that were evident from the start. The naming honor placed rebel officers who had sought to destroy the Union on equal footing with distinguished Union commanders who had preserved the nation through a catastrophic war that cost more than 600,000 lives.The base names also validated a pernicious Confederate myth that depicted Black people as willing, loyal slaves and cast the Southern cause as an honorable attempt to secure \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u2019\u2019 rather than as a bid to keep Black people in chains.Princeton University\u2019s board of trustees acknowledged the lingering effects of Wilson\u2019s racism last month by voting to expunge his name from Princeton\u2019s prestigious public policy school. As the university\u2019s president noted in a statement, Woodrow Wilson took \u201cAmerica backward in its pursuit of justice. He not only acquiesced in but added to the persistent practice of racism in this country, a practice that continues to do harm today.\u201dThe Confederate base names are fruit of that same poisonous tree. President Trump would no doubt preserve them in perpetuity if he could. But outside the White House, public opinion is moving swiftly in the opposite direction. A majority of Americans now reject the notion that Confederate place names and monuments to white supremacy deserve to hold pride of place forever in the civic landscape.This shift in opinion \u2014 accelerated this year by the barbaric police killing of George Floyd \u2014 accounts for recent decisions by the Marine Corps, the Navy and NASCAR to ban the display of the Confederate flag. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates cited the Floyd killing when he called for removing Confederate names from Southern Army bases as a way of putting to rest this \u201cdark side of our history.\u201dSupport for the idea is clearly building at the Pentagon; among influential former military officers; and in Congress, where a pending bill would require the Defense Department to strip Confederate names from military assets \u2014 including bases, installations and streets \u2014 within three years. In other words, the Confederate base names are destined to be erased \u2014 if not during the Trump years, then in the not distant future.A New Military HistoryWhen the search for replacement names gets underway, a fine starting point would be the list of more than 2,400 Army service members who have received the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for bravery. To move past the Army\u2019s lingering legacy of white supremacy, however, the Pentagon will need to look beyond the usual white, male suspects.The Army\u2019s Black heritage celebrations make a show of recognizing African-Americans who have laid down their lives in the nation\u2019s wars even as they were being deprived of full citizenship. The new base names ought to reflect this understanding. When the Pentagon revisits the Civil War in search of such names, it should select those that convey the true nature of the conflict and the full range of people who participated in it.The celebrated Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, for whom a U.S. base was once named in Panama, fits that description. Starting out as almost pathologically unsure of himself, he matured into a tactician who achieved crushing victories in the late stanzas of the war.Besieged by formerly enslaved people who needed food and shelter, Sherman issued his well-known Field Order 15, which set aside vast stretches of coastal land in South Carolina and Georgia for settlement by formerly enslaved families.When the white South reasserted power, the dream of Black land ownership was quickly reversed. Nevertheless, a refrain used to describe Sherman\u2019s order \u2014 \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d \u2014 encapsulated the aspirations of formerly enslaved people during the 19th century. The phrase is still heard today in discussions of reparations for slavery and economy inequality.The Pentagon also needs to bear in mind that not everyone who rendered heroic service in the war was male. One such hero was the former slave Harriet Tubman. Mainly known for guiding escaped slaves to freedom, Tubman was widely praised during the Civil War for her work as a Union Army spy and scout. Tubman has also been described as the only woman to play a central role in planning and executing a Civil War military operation.The bold raid by Union soldiers along the Combahee River in South Carolina in 1863 was intended to punish slaveholding plantations and recruit for the Union\u2019s Black regiments. The raid freed more than 700 enslaved people, some of whom enlisted, and wreaked havoc on the area by burning crops, bridges and other property. By actualizing Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation \u2014 which proclaimed freedom for the enslaved in the rebel states \u2014 the raid helped to define the meaning of the war at a time when the outcome was in doubt.The Civil War surgeon and spy Dr. Mary Walker \u2014 the only woman to be awarded the Medal of Honor \u2014 is certainly worthy of consideration. At a time when only a handful of American women held medical degrees, Walker left the comfort of her private practice in New York to treat sick and wounded troops. As the journalist Cate Lineberry wrote several years ago in The Times, Walker was repeatedly denied a formal commission as an Army surgeon because of her gender. She directly petitioned Abraham Lincoln for help, to no avail. She eventually landed what Ms. Lineberry describes as \u201can unofficial civilian contract\u201d and was sent to Chattanooga, Tenn.As Walker\u2019s reputation grew, families sought her out to treat kinfolk injured in battle. She served as a spy for Sherman\u2019s Army and saw her health damaged by several hard months in a Confederate prisoner of war camp. That Generals Sherman and George H. Thomas both recommended her for the Medal of Honor should be testament enough to her bravery. Nevertheless, the medal was unjustly revoked in the early 20th century \u2014 though it was restored under President Jimmy Carter in 1977.Racism in \u2018the Greatest Generation\u2019Pentagon officials in search of honorees from the World War II era face an embarrassment of riches among white, male candidates.The marquee names include:Gen. Omar Bradley, a plain-spoken, highly effective tactician whose caring attitude toward infantrymen earned him a reputation as \u201cthe G.I.\u2019s general.\u201d He received four of his five general stars by distinguishing himself during World War II.And Gen. George C. Marshall, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who served as Army chief of staff, secretary of state and secretary of defense. He\u2019s mainly known for the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan, which helped to rebuild Europe after the war. His influence extends well beyond the military into international diplomacy.Institutional racism has left the face of military heroism whiter than it would otherwise be. This problem dates to an early 20th century Army advisory that declared Black servicemen as a class unfit for military leadership. This stereotype was reinforced by the formal segregation of the military, which lasted until 1948. By separating troops \u2014 and even the wartime blood bank \u2014 by race and confining most African-Americans to support roles, the Army licensed white commanders to think of Black soldiers as inferior human beings and to overlook acts of heroism by African-Americans in battle. A glaring case of justice delayed is that of a World War I veteran, Cpl. Freddie Stowers, who was mortally wounded while leading his men in a heroic attack on the enemy in France. His 1918 nomination for the Medal of Honor had languished for more than 70 years when President George Bush awarded the honor in 1991.Similarly, six of the seven African-Americans who deserved Medals of Honor for valor in Italy during World War II were dead by the time President Bill Clinton awarded their medals more than a half-century later. The only living recipient was 77-year-old Vernon Joseph Baker, who, as a young second lieutenant in Northern Italy, destroyed multiple enemy machine gun posts, killed several German soldiers and drew enemy fire, allowing his comrades to evacuate.Looking back, Lieutenant Baker recalled with bitterness how hurt he had been that white officers presumed that Black soldiers were cowards \u2014 but also how that hurt had made him all the more determined to carry out his mission on the day of the battle in 1944, near the Tuscan town of Viareggio. \u201cAnd what made me really angry,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cwas the fact that nobody gave us any word of encouragement or any words of thanks.\u201dToward a Post-Racist ArmyThe struggle against discrimination in the American military persists to this day, as The Times\u2019s correspondent Helene Cooper showed in a recent article about the persistent whiteness and maleness of military upper leadership. When this history is finally written, one of the standout figures will surely be Clifford Alexander Jr., who was appointed secretary of the Army in 1977, after serving in the trenches of the fight for civil rights.As an aide to President Lyndon Johnson, he helped pass both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and later served as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Alexander worked to better integrate minorities and women into the Army, and it was during his time as Army secretary that Dr. Walker\u2019s Civil War-era Medal of Honor was restored.He later explained in a Times Op-Ed that he had delayed a list of proposed generals because African-American colonels who had served with distinction had not been included. He then instructed those who weighed such matters to examine early performance records and eliminate unfair blemishes that had been influenced by the prejudices of ratings or superior officers. When equity and fairness were restored, Mr. Alexander recalled, Black colonels with sterling records emerged and were promoted.A year after Mr. Alexander\u2019s arrival, a young African-American colonel named Colin Powell was promoted to brigadier general. He went on to become a celebrated four-star general, the youngest officer ever appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and, later, secretary of state. Four decades after Mr. Alexander showed the way, though, the Army is still struggling to curb racial bias in its promotion system.The Confederate base names are a legacy of a shameful compromise with white supremacy that is thoroughly documented in the historical record. Replacing the names of traitors who waged war on the nation in an attempt to keep African-Americans in chains will not make racism magically disappear. But it is clearly an important step in the right direction.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It Must Be Done.", "summary": "Officials need to think outside the school building.", "authors": "By The Editorial Board", "text": "American children need public schools to reopen in the fall. Reading, writing and arithmetic are not even the half of it. Kids need to learn to compete and to cooperate. They need food and friendships; books and basketball courts; time away from family and a safe place to spend it.Parents need public schools, too. They need help raising their children, and they need to work.In Britain, the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health has warned that leaving schools closed \u201crisks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people.\u201d The organization\u2019s American counterpart, the American Academy of Pediatrics, has urged administrators to begin from \u201ca goal of having students physically present in school.\u201dHere is what it\u2019s going to take: more money and more space.The return to school, as with other aspects of pre-pandemic normalcy, rests on the nation\u2019s ability to control the spread of the coronavirus. In communities where the virus is spreading rapidly, school is likely to remain virtual. The rise in case counts across much of the country is jeopardizing even the best-laid plans for classroom education.Other nations are checking the spread of the virus and preparing to reopen schools. America, by contrast, is squandering its chance and failing its children.But even in places where the virus is under control, schools lack the means to safely provide full-time instruction. In New York City, the nation\u2019s largest school district says that it can only safely provide a few days each week of in-person instruction.Other large districts, like Fairfax County, Va., and Clark County, Nev., have announced similar plans for a partial return to the classroom in the fall.To maximize in-person instruction, the federal government must open its checkbook.Districts need hundreds of billions of dollars to cover the gap between the rapid decline in tax revenue caused by the virus and the rapid rise in costs also caused by the virus. Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend, among other things, the installation of physical barriers in common areas, increased cleaning and daily health checks. The School Superintendents Association estimates that necessary protective measures would cost about $1.8 million for an average district of eight schools and 3,500 students. With more than 13,000 school districts in the United States, the total adds up.House Democrats passed a bill in May that included some aid for schools, but Senate Republicans have neither considered it nor passed an alternative. President Trump could set an example by wearing a mask, and by urging states to require masks. He could work to expand testing. He could work to get money to schools.Instead, Mr. Trump has sent tweets, demanding in ALL CAPS that schools reopen \u2014 and threatening to cut off existing federal funding.Crucially, money alone is not enough. If safety dictates that classrooms can hold only half as many students, it follows that schools need twice as much room. Some of that space can be found by repurposing gyms and cafeterias, but districts including New York have cited a lack of space as a key reason students won\u2019t be able to return full time.Officials need to think outside the building. Some fall classes could be held in the open air, or under tents with no walls \u2014 spaces in which the available evidence suggests transmission risks also are much lower. In Denmark, schools held spring classes on playgrounds, in public parks and even in the stands of the national soccer stadium.Some states, including Florida, Minnesota and Connecticut, have encouraged schools to use available outdoor space. Particularly in cities, where space is scarce, officials should give serious consideration to closing streets around schools and holding classes there.Under the circumstances, public education is surely the best use of those public spaces.Outdoor education is not a cure-all. Students still would need to use shared bathrooms. Equipment still would need to be stored in buildings. Environmental conditions also are a limiting factor: heat, rain, high winds \u2014 and air pollution.But American communities need to choose among the available options.The limits of virtual classrooms were on painful display this spring. While some students thrived, or at least continued to learn, others faded away. Boston reported that roughly 20 percent of enrolled students never logged in. In Los Angeles, one-third of high school students failed to participate. In Washington, D.C., the school system simply gave up and ended the school year three weeks early. Evidence suggests schools particularly struggled to reach lower-income kids, exacerbating performance gaps.The closures also have also deprived students of time with friends, limited their access to reliable meals, physical and mental health care and reduced the availability of support for those with special needs. Students have been thrown back on the resources of their families, and in every dimension, those with the fewest resources have tended to suffer most \u2014 a pattern certain to continue in the fall.The economic damage is real, too. The consulting firm McKinsey estimates that 27 million American workers require child care, which includes schools, to return to full-time work.Many teachers, and parents, are wary of reopening schools. They fear policymakers will cut corners and safety measures will prove inadequate. These fears have been reinforced by the president and by Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have publicly encouraged corner-cutting. Such a strategy is willfully shortsighted. It might succeed in reopening schools for a time, but it is not likely to allow schools to remain open.This week, the president and vice president called on the C.D.C. to relax its public health guidelines for safely reopening schools. The agency\u2019s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, refused. The lesson here is for local officials to ignore the president, as well.

It\u2019s also the bare minimum Americans should expect. The bad news is that Mr. Trump has again figured out how to game the legal system to his advantage, to dance along the edges of the law that the rest of us are expected to abide by.The bottom line is that Mr. Trump will almost certainly get to keep hiding his tax returns (Remember those? The ones he promised to release five years ago?) and his other financial records from the American people, who will be asked to decide in a matter of months whether to give him another term.From the day he took office, Mr. Trump has governed as though democratic checks and balances are optional. \u201cI can do whatever I want,\u201d he has said, more than once. This includes intervening in federal prosecutions to protect his friends, soliciting foreign interference in American elections and tear-gassing peaceful protesters for a photo op.Nearly 250 years after another ruler\u2019s abuses of power drove the American colonists to revolution, the lesson remains clear: We must always keep close watch on our leaders. In two separate decisions on Thursday, the Supreme Court reminded Mr. Trump of that history, ruling 7 to 2 that he could not ignore subpoenas of his financial records from Congress and from a New York prosecutor.\u201cIn our judicial system, \u2018the public has a right to every man\u2019s evidence,\u2019 \u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court in Trump v. Vance. \u201cSince the earliest days of the Republic, \u2018every man\u2019 has included the president of the United States.\u201dThe case concerned a subpoena for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns issued by Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, who appears to be investigating whether Mr. Trump and others broke campaign-finance laws before and during his presidency. Mr. Trump claimed \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from the subpoena. On that point, the justices shot him down unanimously.\u201cNo citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\u201d the chief justice wrote.The court rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that answering the subpoena would distract him from his official duties \u2014 an amusing gripe from a president who seems to spend most of his day watching cable news and spouting off on Twitter. \u201cCourts in the past have given \u2018broad deference,\u2019\u201d the president tweeted in response to the ruling. \u201cBUT NOT ME!\u201dThat\u2019s not true, of course. As the court pointed out, Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton lost the same argument by unanimous rulings, and with cases that were stronger than Mr. Trump\u2019s. The claim of presidential immunity \u201cruns up against the 200 years of precedent establishing that presidents, and their official communications, are subject to judicial process, even when the president is under investigation,\u201d the court wrote.In the other case decided on Thursday, Trump v. Mazars, the court took on Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that he did not have to answer to Congress. Last year, three separate House subcommittees subpoenaed Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm and a bank for his family\u2019s and his business\u2019s financial records. The subcommittees said they needed those documents to draft laws relating to Mr. Trump\u2019s possible foreign or domestic conflicts of interest, as well as to government ethics, banking and foreign interference in elections.\u201cWhen Congress seeks information needed for intelligent legislative action, it unquestionably remains the duty of all citizens to cooperate,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote. In other words, Congress can subpoena the president\u2019s records, and courts can enforce those subpoenas. But presidential subpoenas also raise \u201cspecial concerns\u201d regarding the separation of powers, the court said. It laid out factors that courts must consider, including the need for such evidence, the amount and nature of evidence being sought and the burden a subpoena places on the president.Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented from both rulings, although they agreed with the central point that the president does not have absolute immunity.Still, the upshot of these rulings is that, while Mr. Trump is not legally immune from investigation, he is effectively immune from it. Rather than uphold the validity of the subpoenas, as the lower federal courts had done, the Supreme Court sent both cases back to the lower courts, giving Mr. Trump another chance to delay and come up with more arguments about why the American people should be kept in the dark. (Mr. Trump could still be criminally prosecuted by the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office after he leaves the White House.)Whether he was breaking fair-housing laws and cheating on taxes as a real estate developer, or interfering with federal investigations into his own abuses of power as an elected official, Mr. Trump has always staked his survival on the fact that the wheels of justice grind slowly.The American people need to know as much as possible about their presidential candidates. They need to trust that the person they choose will put the nation\u2019s interests ahead of his own. As long as Mr. Trump is president and can hide his vast web of finances, they will never be able to do so.What is the solution? Mr. Trump won\u2019t release his tax records voluntarily. The Internal Revenue Service, apparently, won\u2019t look at them as required by law. Neither Congress nor a state prosecutor is likely to get them before the election. And congressional Republicans have, with virtually no exceptions, bent the knee.The court\u2019s rulings hold the line, at least \u2014 ensuring that presidents cannot simply disregard congressional oversight or criminal investigation. But the fact that it took nearly a full term in office for the courts to articulate such a fundamental constitutional truth, and that still Congress and the American people will be left wondering, is damning evidence that justice delayed is justice denied.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Again.", "summary": "Justices rule that employers can stand between female workers and their health care.", "authors": "By The Editorial Board", "text": "Well, that didn\u2019t take long.Only days after surprising the nation by striking down a strict anti-abortion law in Louisiana, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts reminded Americans once again that it is no friend to reproductive rights, or to the vast majority of women who will use some form of birth control in their lifetime.In a decision Wednesday, the justices dealt another blow to the birth control mandate under the Affordable Care Act. In the wake of the 7-to-2 ruling in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, \u201cbetween 70,500 and 126,400 women would immediately lose access to no-cost contraceptive services,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her dissent, citing a government estimate.The Little Sisters of the Poor is an order of Catholic nuns who are religiously opposed to birth control. (Many conservatives wrongly conflate some methods of birth control with abortion.) They\u2019re also opposed to the A.C.A.\u2019s birth-control mandate, which says that insurance plans sponsored by large employers must include preventive care \u2014 including all forms of birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 at no additional cost. That\u2019s why, if women have insurance through work, they probably have not been charged a co-pay to get birth control pills or an intrauterine device in recent years.The order of nuns \u2014 along with other entities, like the company Hobby Lobby, that have taken issue with the contraception mandate \u2014 say that it violates their religious liberty under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law. The religious order feels this way despite the fact that religious nonprofits already were able to exempt themselves from the contraception mandate by merely filling out a form. In other words, the Little Sisters of the Poor did not have to pay for a single birth control pill.The litigation on this issue has been continuing for the better part of the past decade. Then the Trump administration, which has consistently sided with anti-abortion activists, came along, vastly expanding the exemptions to the contraception mandate so that any company that isn\u2019t publicly traded can opt out, if it has a religious or a moral objection. States sued to block those regulations, the case made it to the Supreme Court and here we are: The court has upheld the Trump administration\u2019s expanded exemptions to the mandate, on administrative grounds, making it harder for many thousands of American women to get birth control.It bears reminding that the cost of birth control can be significant, and that many women rely on it not just to prevent pregnancy but to treat medical issues. Sometimes, the contraceptive method that works best \u2014\u00a0or the only one a person can tolerate \u2014 costs many hundreds of dollars without insurance coverage.It also bears reminding that the Trump administration has been attacking both the A.C.A. and access to birth control since the moment President Trump took office. On the latter front, its most successful effort before this week was to gut the nation\u2019s decades-old family planning program, called Title X, in an explicit effort to cripple Planned Parenthood. All of the administration\u2019s efforts on this front have most directly affected poor women and women of color.Finally, it bears reminding that this Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority, with Chief Justice Roberts at the helm, has been very friendly to religious litigants.It\u2019s hard to imagine the conservative justices of this court, especially, allowing employers to claim a moral exemption and require their employees to pay out of pocket for, say, a treatment for Covid-19. That sounds absurd. And yet, when it comes to birth control, such state interference with personal health decisions is considered a legitimate matter for public debate.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

But the White House ought to stay the course toward a peace deal.", "authors": "By The Editorial Board", "text": "There\u2019s a lot still missing from the reports that Russia paid for attacks on American and other coalition forces in Afghanistan. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that emotions and politics be kept at bay until the facts are in. Some important context might come from a hearing on the matter by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, even though Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, has declined to attend.The charges are explosive, and the public \u2014 especially the families of fallen soldiers \u2014 deserves some honest answers. The reports in The Times and other news media cite intelligence findings that a Russian military intelligence unit rewarded fighters linked to the Taliban for targeting American troops, possibly disbursing money through a shadowy Afghan middleman named Rahmatullah Azizi. The findings are said to have been relayed to the White House in a regular intelligence briefing that President Trump says he never saw.The logical next step for the president should have been to acknowledge the gravity of the allegations and demand a full report. Instead, Mr. Trump dismissed the story in a tweet as \u201cjust another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,\u201d even as he acknowledged that the information was contained in intelligence reports. Inevitably, the response resurrected speculation about Mr. Trump\u2019s unexplained affinity for Vladimir Putin, most recently displayed in attempts to include the Russian leader in a meeting of the Group of 7.Robert O\u2019Brien, the national security adviser, said this month that the Justice Department was considering an investigation into whomever may have leaked the information.The Trump administration\u2019s response to this story raises critical questions about whether it is focusing sufficient attention on the plight of American soldiers deployed far from their homeland and on dangerous ground. John Bolton\u2019s new book about his time as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser is only the latest depiction of a president incapable of absorbing policy briefings.But this issue is not solely a question of Mr. Trump\u2019s competence. From the various news accounts, others in the White House and Congress were also apparently advised of the claims, yet no one reacted until the allegations were made public in The Times.Then there\u2019s the question of the motives behind the leaks and the solidity of the information. The Wall Street Journal, for one, reported that the National Security Agency \u2014\u00a0which specializes in electronic espionage \u2014 strongly dissented from other intelligence agencies over the strength of the intelligence. For agencies to differ in their assessments of intelligence is not unusual in the business of espionage, which by its nature often deals in circumstantial evidence. What the differences were in this case is not known, but they probably account for Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the intelligence did not reach him because it \u201cdidn\u2019t rise to that level.\u201dOther questions abound: When did the reported payments begin? Were they payback for American support of Afghan militants against Soviet troops there in the 1980s, or something else? Were the payments a factor in the deaths of any American or other coalition troops? Was the intelligence tweaked by people seeking to hinder efforts to withdraw American troops?Coalition forces suffered a spate of casualties in Afghanistan last summer and early fall, but there have been only a few deaths since. Four Americans were killed by hostile fire incidents early this year, but the Taliban has not attacked American positions since it signed an agreement with the United States in late February. (Five other Americans died this year in nonhostile accidents or crashes.) A spokesman for the Taliban said the reports of any deal with Russian intelligence agencies were \u201cbaseless.\u201d Russian officials have said they\u2019ll respond if and when they hear concrete accusations.Mr. Pompeo has declined to comment on the specifics of the intelligence reports of bounties, but he noted in a recent interview that Russia\u2019s involvement in Afghanistan was nothing new and was regularly raised with Russian officials. \u201cThere are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces,\u201d he said, noting that Iran and Pakistan have also provided aid to the Taliban over the years.Afghanistan is a forbidding country that has repeatedly confounded invaders. There is no question that the war there has been rife with atrocities, shifting alliances and dubious sources of funds and arms. Mr. Trump is right to try to pull Americans out after more than two decades of inconclusive fighting.Yet the public anger aroused by the bounties story will not go away by claiming \u201choax,\u201d or dismissing the payments as collateral damage of a dirty war. Legislators from both parties are already demanding explanations, and the House Armed Services Committee voted by a large bipartisan majority for an amendment to the defense bill to make any further withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan contingent on an assessment of whether any country has offered incentives for the Taliban to attack American and other coalition troops.It is unfortunate to connect the issue of possible Russian payoffs with the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The administration ought to provide more information to lawmakers, which is why it was a missed opportunity for Mr. Pompeo to decline to attend the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.But whatever those investigations reveal, the war in Afghanistan needs to be brought to an end. Mr. Putin\u2019s intelligence services shouldn\u2019t get a say in what is in the best interests of the United States.The threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal deal alone should encourage the president to get to the bottom of the issue, and if necessary to confront Russia with the numerous tools of statecraft at his disposal.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

That\u2019s exactly where they\u2019ve burrowed.After the release of \u201cMourning in America,\u201d which turned Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous \u201cMorning in America\u201d commercial on its head, Trump had one of his trademark Twitter meltdowns. He shrieked at Conway in particular, mentioning his marriage to one of Trump\u2019s brashest aides.\u201cI don\u2019t know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cbut it must have been really bad.\u201dSuch grace. But if George Conway can just shake it off and the Lincoln Project succeeds, he and his fellow refugees from Trump\u2019s Republican Party will find peace and a place in a restored, recognizable political order on the other side. Right?Wrong. They don\u2019t hope to regain control of the Republican Party, because they expect that Trump-ism will survive Trump and that Trump himself won\u2019t shut up simply because voters shut him down.\u201cI personally think that the Republican brand is probably destroyed,\u201d Conway told me. \u201cIt\u2019s destroyed by it having become essentially a personality cult.\u201d He said that he formally left the party, changing his voter registration to unaffiliated, some two years ago, and he doesn\u2019t envision being able to return anytime soon.But the Lincoln Project\u2019s full-court press for Joe Biden, which involves social media and grass-roots organizing as well as internet and television ads, doesn\u2019t mean that Conway and company are looking for a welcome mat in the Democratic Party. Not at all.That\u2019s what\u2019s so fascinating about their quest. They\u2019re not fighting to come in from the wilderness. The wilderness is a given. They\u2019re just fighting to get rid of this one sun-hogging, diseased redwood \u2014 or orangewood, as the case may be.I asked Conway, \u201cSo you\u2019ll be a man without a party for the rest of your days?\u201d\u201cProbably,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me tremendously sad.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to miss or minimize how remarkable the Never Trumpers \u2014 at the Lincoln Project and elsewhere \u2014 are. That\u2019s partly because they\u2019ve been around almost since Trump\u2019s presidential campaign commenced, so they\u2019ve lost their novelty and some of their luster.But they\u2019ve gained in ranks and grown in determination, to a point where you have to go back to 1972 \u2014 when many prominent Democrats endorsed President Richard Nixon, a Republican, over George McGovern, the Democratic nominee \u2014 to find anything close.And even that precedent doesn\u2019t quite hold up. As the historian Timothy Naftali told me, the Democrats for Nixon split with him primarily along ideological lines, and they weren\u2019t trying to undermine an incumbent president. Never Trumpers are doing precisely that, and while they have ideological quibbles with Trump, they\u2019re motivated principally by their belief that he\u2019s something of a monster.\u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented moment,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a founder and editor-at-large of The Bulwark, a Trump-bashing publication begun in 2018 by Trump-disgusted Republicans like him. Sykes no longer considers himself a Republican. He described himself to me as \u201ca politically homeless contrarian conservative.\u201dThe Bulwark shares personnel and DNA with Republican Voters Against Trump and Republicans for the Rule of Law, all bastions of Never Trumpers. There\u2019s also a new super PAC called 43 Alumni for Biden, a reference to George W. Bush, the 43rd president. It comprises scores of alumni of his administration who want to see Biden beat Trump, and it intends to release testimonials from former senior Bush administration officials.As for the Lincoln Project, it\u2019s helmed not by a ragtag band of renegades but by a cluster of strategists who worked for Bush, John McCain or Mitt Romney and were well-connected Republican insiders until Trump\u2019s takeover. The anti-Trump rebellion is distinguished by the pedigree of the rebels.And it exists in paradoxical tension with the equally remarkable loyalty that most Republicans give the president. In the same manner that Trump triggers outsize dissent, he inspires outsize support. He\u2019s just plain outsize. Depending on the moment, about 80 percent to 90 percent of voters who identify as Republican tell pollsters that they stand behind Trump.They\u2019re the reason that some political observers see what the Lincoln Project and its kin are doing as an exercise in protracted political suicide. Even if Trump and his minions get a resounding comeuppance in November, \u201cIt seems unlikely that Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham and Rush Limbaugh will apologize to the Cassandras and say, \u2018You were right all along!\u2019\u201d Matt Lewis, a conservative, wrote recently in a column in the Daily Beast under the headline \u201cThe Never Trumpers May Destroy Him. Then What?\u201dSykes at The Bulwark conceded: \u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think that the Republican Party is going to snap back to sanity anytime soon. The fact that people are talking about Tucker Carlson in 2024 shows you how far they\u2019ve gone.\u201dSo does that make these Never Trumpers some uniquely high-minded breed? It\u2019s complicated. While they broke with the Republican Party on principle, they may well have expected the Trump fever to break \u2014 and for other Republicans to follow them \u2014 in short order. Meanwhile, Never Trump-ism had its perks, or at least its consolations.There\u2019s an especially rapt audience for takedowns of Trump from conservatives, and Never Trumpers have found themselves in high demand as commentators and book authors.Through some of their anti-Trump organizations, funded by donors, some of them have arranged employment no longer available to them in conventional Republican circles. In The Atlantic recently, Andrew Ferguson fairly called out individual Never Trumpers for inconsistency, hypocrisy and opportunism, and raised questions about the degree to which a few of the people with the Lincoln Project are profiting from it.But the most important syllable in Never Trumper is Trump, and Never Trumpers are essentially sowing the seeds of their own diminished relevance by working to get rid of him.That\u2019s why, when I look at them, I see patriotism, though John Weaver \u2014 who, along with Conway, helped to found the Lincoln Project \u2014 emphasized a different idea when we spoke. He stressed atonement.Trump\u2019s election made him revisit how he and other Republican strategists had paved the way for Trump. For instance, Weaver worked for the man who was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump for president.\u201cJeff Sessions wouldn\u2019t have gotten to the Senate had I not overseen his race in 1996,\u201d Weaver told me. \u201cNow I look back at that and say, \u2018What kind of goddamn penance do I have to pay for that?\u2019\u201dSykes spoke of \u201ca revelation\u201d that he has experienced, courtesy of Trump. \u201cThe heart of politics is not about the policy,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about the values. I can disagree with you on eight out of 10 issues, but if you\u2019re an honorable, honest, empathetic human being, we can do business.\u201d Trump is none of those things. Biden is most or all of them \u2014 and will get Sykes\u2019s vote in November.In exile he and other Never Trumpers have found clarity. They cut to the heart of the matter. That\u2019s reflected in a Lincoln Project ad from late May that begins with a close-up of body bags and then pulls back until those bags form an American flag. These words appear over it: \u201c100,000 Dead Americans. One Wrong President.\u201dI don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll tip the election.

Across the 2000s and early 2010s, China\u2019s ruling party reaped the benefits of globalization without paying the cost, in political liberalization, that confident Westerners expected the economic opening to impose. This richer-but-not-freer China proved that it was possible for an authoritarian power to tame the internet, to make its citizens hardworking capitalists without granting them substantial political freedoms, to buy allies across the developing world, and to establish beachheads of influence \u2014 in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, American academia, the NBA, Washington, D.C. \u2014 in the power centers of its superpower rival.Eventually, America responded to all this as you would expect a superpower to react: It elected a China hawk who promised to get tough on Beijing, to bring back jobs lost to the China shock, and to shift foreign policy priorities from the Middle East to the Pacific. But there was one small difficulty: This hawk was no Truman or Reagan, but rather a reality-television mountebank whose real attitude toward China policy was, basically, whatever gets me re-elected works. A mountebank, and also a world-historical incompetent, who was presented with exactly the challenge that his nationalism was supposed to answer \u2014 a dangerous disease carried by global trade routes from our leading rival \u2014 and managed to turn it into an American calamity instead.So China has won twice over: First rising with the active collaboration of na\u00efve American centrists, and then consolidating its gains with the de facto collaboration of a feckless American populist. Four months into the coronavirus era, Xi Jinping\u2019s government is throttling Hong Kong, taking tiny bites out of India, saber-rattling with its other neighbors, and perpetrating a near-genocide in its Muslim West. Meanwhile America is rudderless and leaderless, consumed by protests and elite psychodrama and a moral crusade whose zeal seems turned entirely inward, with no time to spare for a rival power\u2019s crimes.Furthermore, Trump\u2019s likely successor is a figure whose record and instincts and family connections all belong to the recent period of American illusions about China. Joe Biden speaks more hawkishly than he did five years ago, but the very thing that makes him effective as a foil to Trump \u2014 his promise of a return to Obama-era normalcy \u2014 also makes him an unlikely person to drastically re-evaluate the choices that gave China its advantages today.If you were scripting a historical moment when a rising power overtakes a fading hegemon, the cascade from establishment na\u00efvet\u00e9 through Trumpian folly to the coronavirus disaster would be almost too on-the-nose. And foreign policy hands who fear a \u201cThucydides trap\u201d \u2014 a scenario where a rising and an established power end up, like Athens and Sparta, in a war \u2014 have good reasons to be nervous about how the current combination of Chinese ambition and American decline might play out in, say, the Taiwan Strait.But there is another way to look at things. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019re nearing a peak of U.S.-China tension not because China is poised to permanently overtake the United States as a global power, but because China itself is peaking \u2014 with a slowing growth rate that may leave it short of the prosperity achieved by its Pacific neighbors, a swiftly aging population, and a combination of self-limiting soft power and maxed-out hard power that\u2019s likely to diminish, relative to the U.S. and India and others, in the 2040s and beyond.Instead of a Chinese Century, in other words, the coronavirus might be ushering in a Chinese Decade, in which Xi Jinping\u2019s government behaves with maximal aggression because it sees an opportunity that won\u2019t come again.That aggression has inward and outward manifestations. The inward form is the attempt to lock in Han pre-eminence in China by forcibly suppressing non-Han birthrates, so that population decline doesn\u2019t lead to swings in ethnic power. The outward form is what you see in Hong Kong and might see with Taiwan soon \u2014 an attempt to reach greedily for Greater China goals because the odds of success look better now than in the further future.If this is China\u2019s true strategic calculus, it won\u2019t make the 2020s any less dangerous. (History is thick with reckless decisions made because great powers felt that long-term trends had turned against them.) But it should condition the U.S. policy response, whether under a President Biden or a future Republican with more capabilities than Trump, toward a balance between resolve and caution, hawkishness and restraint.If we show too much indecision and weakness, or just too obvious a desire for the pre-Trump status quo, then Beijing\u2019s escalation will continue, and the risks of war will rise.But if we find a way to contain China for a decade, the Chinese century could be permanently postponed.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Which statues toppled? What will later generations see as our own ethical blind spots?I believe that one will be our cruelty to animals. Modern society relies on factory farming to produce protein that is inexpensive and abundant. But it causes suffering to animals on an incalculable scale.Over the last 200 years, the world has become far more sensitive to animal rights. In feudal Europe, a game consisted of nailing a cat to a post and head-butting it to death; now, growing numbers of states have passed animal protection laws, McDonald\u2019s is moving to cage-free eggs and there are legal debates about whether certain mammals should have standing to sue in courts.The upshot is court cases like Cetacean Community v. Bush, in which the plaintiffs were whales, dolphins and porpoises, and Naruto, a Crested Macaque, v. Slater.Pope Francis suggests that animals go to heaven, and many humans would agree: Paradise would be diminished without pets.Yet while we adore our pets and coddle them \u2014 a dog in a wealthy family may get better medical and dental care than a child in a poor family \u2014 we as a society often do not extend this empathy to unseen farm animals, especially poultry.Some 9.3 billion chickens were slaughtered last year in the United States \u2014 28 per American \u2014 and here\u2019s how they are typically killed: Workers shove the chickens\u2019 legs into metal shackles, and the birds are then carried upside down to an electrified bath that stuns them before a circular saw cuts open their necks and they are dunked in scalding water.Even when this system works perfectly, chickens sometimes have legs or wings broken as they are shackled. When the system fails, they are not stunned and struggle frantically as they are carried to the saw. The saw in turn misses many birds \u2014 the Agriculture Department says that 526,000 chickens were not slaughtered correctly last year \u2014 and some are boiled alive.A child who plucks out a bird\u2019s feathers may be punished, but corporate executives who torture birds by the billions are showered with stock options.Factory farming also diminishes human frontline workers, from struggling farmers who raise animals to the miserably paid and poorly protected slaughterhouse employees now falling ill from the coronavirus.In the face of all this, attitudes are changing: Eight percent of young American adults said in 2018 that they were vegetarians, compared with just 2 percent of Americans 55 and older.I became a vegetarian almost two years ago (not a strict one, and I do eat fish) because my daughter nagged me (\u201cprovided moral guidance\u201d would be a nicer spin), and I suspect that ethical and environmental considerations \u2014 and the increasing availability of tasty alternatives to meat \u2014 will lead our descendants to eat less meat, and be baffled at our casual acceptance of an industrial agricultural model built on large-scale cruelty.\u201cOne day future generations will look back on our abuse of animals in factory farms with the same attitude that we have to the cruelties of the Roman \u2018games\u2019 at the Colosseum,\u201d Peter Singer, a Princeton University philosopher, told me. \u201cThey will wonder how we could be blind to the suffering we are so needlessly inflicting on billions of animals.\u201dA second area that I think will leave future generations baffled at our heartlessness is our indifference to suffering in impoverished countries. More than five million young children will die this year around the world from diarrhea, malnutrition or other ailments; we let these children perish essentially because of our own tribalism. They are not a priority to us.While I denounced the mistreatment of broiler chickens, it\u2019s only fair to note that about 5 percent of those birds die prematurely. In contrast, 7.8 percent of children in sub-Saharan Africa die by the age of 5, according to UNICEF. So heartless agribusiness concerns do a better job ensuring the survival of baby chicks than the international community sometimes does for human babies.A third area where I suspect our descendants will judge us harshly is climate change. Our generation\u2019s denialism will lead to more extreme weather, more flooded homes, more heat waves \u2014 and resentment that early-21st-century humans could have been so selfish as to refuse to take small steps to reduce carbon emissions.I raised this issue of our moral blind spots in my email newsletter the other day, and one reader, Brad Marston, a physics professor at Brown University, put it this way: \u201cIn 100 years our generation may be as poorly regarded as 19th-century racists are today (or worse), due to our failure to tackle climate change, leaving a damaged and possibly ruined planet to future generations.\u201dSo I\u2019m all for re-examining history and removing statues of Confederate generals. But just as important is our obligation to think deeply about our own moral myopia today and address it while there is still time.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The European Union diluting nationalist identity; the welfare state cushioning the social divisions dictators may exploit; NATO transforming the United States into a European power and the ultimate protector of democracy against totalitarian ideologies.This was Europe\u2019s collective response to its double suicide in the first half of the 20th century. It was not just Germany that had to resurrect itself from the rubble of \u201czero hour\u201d in 1945, but the whole continent. Europeans owed it to the myriad corpses beneath their every step to build societies and institutions that were fascism-proof.No wonder President Trump, whose dictatorial inclinations are as hard to suppress as Dr. Strangelove\u2019s Nazi salute, hates these European institutions so much. His itch is to undermine, or even destroy, them. \u201cI\u2019m a nationalist,\u201d he once said. Yes, he is \u2014 flags, military flyovers, walls, monuments and all, in exaltation of \u201cthe greatest, most exceptional and most virtuous nation in the history of the world,\u201d as he put it on July 4.Since arriving in France, I\u2019ve heard a couple of French people describe Trump as \u201cfunny.\u201d For Europeans, the novelty of America\u2019s showman has worn off. He\u2019s a loudmouth. He\u2019s a fool. These observations have emerged from societies that have settled their painful scores with history and found a middling security. The United States, however, has not. In fact, I think Trump has just entered the most dangerous phase of his presidency.It is important to see Trump in historical context. The country he took over had been through a seesawing quarter-century of trauma. First the giddy all-powerful interlude after the disappearance of the Soviet Union, with its temptations of hubris. Then the disorienting shock of Sept. 11 that shattered the idea of America-the-inviolable and propelled the nation into its wars without victory. Then the Great Recession with its indelible lesson that, as Leonard Cohen put it, \u201cthe poor stay poor, the rich get rich.\u201d Then the fact, irrefutable with the rise of China, of America\u2019s relative decline, a development Barack Obama, the first Black president, opted to manage with cool realism.All this provided the perfect context for \u201ca clumsy, lurching and undiscriminating American nationalism that would boomerang upon itself,\u201d as Jacob Heilbrunn described it in his tribute to Owen Harries, the Australian foreign policy intellectual, who predicted such a fate after Sept. 11.Trump, masterful media manipulator, is the vehicle of that nationalism. He exploited a pervasive sense of American humiliation. It was out there, in search of a voice. Trump is not funny. He is fiendish.Nationalism is not fascism but is a necessary component of it. Both seek to change the present in the name of an illusory past in order to create a future vague in all respects except its glory.One of the core characteristics of fascism is nostalgia, a pining for a culture of masculinity and monumentalism, evident in Hitler\u2019s Nazi Party and the architecture it embraced for the 1,000-year Reich. Trump\u2019s nostalgia is for some unidentified moment of American greatness, when white male property owners ruled alone, the nation\u2019s global dominance was unchallenged, women stayed home, and gender was not 360. By choosing to speak at Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day, Trump attempted to inscribe his nationalism in a monumental narrative of American heroism. It was straight from the autocratic playbook.Another central characteristic of nationalism and fascism is their need to define themselves against an enemy. Trump has chosen his: China, designated as the culprit for the coronavirus debacle (and the scapegoat behind which the president can hide his own equal responsibility); and the \u201cangry mobs\u201d he alluded to at Mount Rushmore who constitute, Trump said, a new \u201cfar-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance.\u201dIt is Trump who demands \u201cabsolute allegiance\u201d \u2014 look at his trembling cabinet \u2014 and whose nationalism is fascist-tinged. He has turned an uprising against racial injustice after the killing of George Floyd into a pretext to lash out against \u201ccriminal\u201d mobs.There have been excesses among the protests. It is always better to try to contextualize history than excise it. Cancel culture is inimical to free speech. But the overarching threat the United States faces in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election is from Trump. The fascism in the air is on the far right of the political spectrum. If Trump could identify national humiliation as his ace in the hole in 2016, he can also seize the potential of the coronavirus pandemic to muddy the waters and stir pervasive fear.Last month, Trump tweeted: \u201cRIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!\u201d Of course, that foreign country would be China.Trump is preparing the ground to contest any loss to Joe Biden and remain president, aided, no doubt, by Attorney General William Barr\u2019s Justice Department.I know, it\u2019s unthinkable.

It would have created a clearinghouse of best practices for maintaining grab-and-go lunch programs and online education. By mid-April it would have convened experts to figure out how to reopen schools safely, and offered grants to schools trying different models.\u201cNone of that has happened,\u201d said Weingarten. \u201cZero.\u201dInstead, Donald Trump has approached the extraordinarily complex challenge of educating children during a pandemic just as he\u2019s approached most other matters of governing: with bullying, bluster and propaganda.While doing nothing to curb the wildfire spread of the coronavirus, he has demanded that schools reopen and threatened to cut off funding for those that don\u2019t. On Wednesday, he tweeted that the guidelines for reopening schools from his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were \u201cvery tough & expensive,\u201d adding, \u201cI will be meeting with them!!!\u201d Mike Pence then suggested that the guidelines would be revised. On Thursday the agency\u2019s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, said they wouldn\u2019t be, but later, seeming to give into pressure, said the guidelines should be seen as recommendations, not requirements.Also on Thursday, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos gestured toward a plan of coronavirus-inspired school choice that would punish public schools that don\u2019t fully reopen. Without offering details, she said families could take the federal money spent at these schools and use it elsewhere. She\u2019s long wanted to give public money to private schools; perhaps she thinks this coronavirus has given her the chance.When I spoke to Weingarten again on Thursday, she wasn\u2019t worried that Trump and DeVos would be able to follow through on their threats; they can\u2019t redirect the funds without Congress. But with their crude attempts at coercion, they\u2019ve politicized school reopening just as Trump politicized mask-wearing and hydroxychloroquine.As a result, the administration has made reopening schools more difficult. \u201cThe threats are empty, but the distrust they have caused is not,\u201d Weingarten said.At the end of June, the American Federation of Teachers surveyed its members and found a broad willingness to return to the classroom. Two-thirds of respondents said school buildings should reopen in some capacity, and 76 percent said they\u2019d be comfortable being in school with the proper safeguards. But after Trump began ranting about schools, Weingarten started hearing from teachers who were scared that reopening would be done rashly.So as Trump tries to turn school reopenings into part of his culture war, Weingarten fears \u201ca huge brain drain of people not willing to be in schools anymore.\u201dTo be clear: As a parent, I want schools to open full-time at least as much as Trump does. On Wednesday, New York City announced its plan to send kids back to school part time, and it is a calamity. To accommodate C.D.C. guidelines calling for six feet of distance between desks, students will be able to go to school only one to three days a week. It is not yet clear if schools will be able to ensure that siblings will attend on the same days. Working parents could end up needing full-time child care indefinitely, and there are, as yet, no plans to provide it publicly.Similar hybrid schedules are being adopted all over the country \u2014 and grim as they are, they might turn out to be too optimistic, because they depend on the virus being somewhat contained. Palm Beach, Fla., just announced that schools there won\u2019t open at all. Other districts in hard-hit areas will likely follow suit.So far, the results of so-called \u201cremote learning\u201d \u2014 a term I dislike, since it presumes that learning is happening \u2014 have been terrible for students, especially disadvantaged ones. The fallout for many parents\u2019 financial prospects and mental health is catastrophic. And part-time schooling is likely to significantly amplify educational inequalities that are already enormous. As those who can afford it hire private teachers and tutors, we are rapidly heading toward a system of neo-governesses in which basic schooling becomes a luxury good unattainable for many people outside the 1 percent.This is almost certainly not why Trump is eager to have school resume. Rather, school closures and staggered schedules are a crushing weight on the economy. To millions of parents, they\u2019re an intimate daily reminder that the president\u2019s incompetence has ruined our lives. But to open schools in a reasonable way, the government needs to do two things: control the pandemic, as most other developed countries have done, and give schools money to adapt. This administration has so far failed to do either.And now the president\u2019s interference with the C.D.C. has made things worse.Here\u2019s the thing: The C.D.C. guidelines might indeed be too stringent, at least for elementary schools. There is some evidence that little kids are less susceptible to Covid-19, and may be less likely to spread it; in countries where schools have reopened, few clusters have been linked to elementary schools. (There have been outbreaks in middle schools and high schools, most notably in Israel.)In a recent statement on school reopenings, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that three feet of distance between desks might be sufficient, particularly if students wear masks. (Admittedly, getting little kids to keep masks on is challenging.) \u201cSchools should weigh the benefits of strict adherence to a 6-feet spacing rule between students with the potential downside if remote learning is the only alternative,\u201d it said.The hybrid model that many large school districts are adopting is meant to limit the number of people whom teachers and students are exposed to. But Elliot Haspel, author of \u201cCrawling Behind: America\u2019s Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It,\u201d points out that if kids disperse to various kinds of child care when they aren\u2019t in school, they could end up being exposed to more people than they would be in a regular classroom.\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have significantly more harm to children and to families pursuing a staggered schedule approach, particularly to elementary school students.\u201dBut Trump\u2019s interference means that now no departure from the current C.D.C. guidelines will be seen as credible outside of MAGAland. \u201cThe recklessness has made people distrust anything that they say because they have downplayed the virus from the beginning,\u201d said Weingarten.Last month, NPR reported on a mostly Black nursing home in Maryland that didn\u2019t lose any residents to Covid because its director listened to what Trump said about the virus and assumed the opposite was true. \u201cWhen I heard President Trump say we only had 15 cases and by the end of the week that it would be zero, I knew that it was time to act,\u201d the director said.This is a president with negative credibility. The more Trump demands that schools open, the more people who\u2019ve paid close attention to him will fear they all must remain closed.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Could Help Humanity", "summary": "", "authors": "By Rachel E. Gross", "text": "TOORBUL, Australia \u2014 The first sign is the smell: smoky, like a campfire, with a hint of urine. The second is the koala\u2019s rear end: If it is damp and inflamed, with streaks of brown, you know the animal is in trouble. Jo, lying curled and unconscious on the examination table, had both.Jo is a wild koala under the purview of Endeavour Veterinary Ecology, a wildlife consulting company that specializes in bringing sick koala populations back from the brink of disease. Vets noticed on their last two field visits that she was sporting \u201ca suspect bum,\u201d as the veterinarian Pip McKay put it. So they brought her and her 1-year-old joey into the main veterinary clinic, which sits in a remote forest clearing in Toorbul, north of Brisbane, for a full health check.Ms. McKay already had an inkling of what the trouble might be. \u201cLooking at her, she probably has chlamydia,\u201d she said.Humans don\u2019t have a monopoly on sexually transmitted infections. Oysters get herpes, rabbits get syphilis, dolphins get genital warts. But chlamydia \u2014 a pared-down, single-celled bacterium that acts like a virus \u2014 has been especially successful, infecting everything from frogs to fish to parakeets. You might say chlamydia connects us all.This shared susceptibility has led some scientists to argue that studying, and saving, koalas may be the key to developing a long-lasting cure for humans. \u201cThey\u2019re out there, they\u2019ve got chlamydia, and we can give them a vaccine, we can observe what the vaccine does under real conditions,\u201d said Peter Timms, a microbiologist at the University of Sunshine Coast in Queensland. He has spent the past decade developing a chlamydia vaccine for koalas, and is now conducting trials on wild koalas, in the hopes that his formula will soon be ready for wider release. \u201cWe can do something in koalas you could never do in humans,\u201d Dr. Timms said.In koalas, chlamydia\u2019s ravages are extreme, leading to severe inflammation, massive cysts and scarring of the reproductive tract. In the worst cases, animals are left yelping in pain when they urinate, and they develop the telltale smell. But the bacteria responsible is still remarkably similar to the human one, thanks to chlamydia\u2019s tiny, highly conserved genome: It has just 900 active genes, far fewer than most infectious bacteria.Because of these similarities, the vaccine trials that Endeavour and Dr. Timms are running may offer valuable clues for researchers across the globe who are developing a human vaccine.A riddle, wrapped in a mysteryHow bad is chlamydia in humans? Consider that around one in 10 sexually active teenagers in the United States is already infected, said Dr. Toni Darville, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with 131 million new cases reported each year.Antibiotics exist, but they are not enough to solve the problem, Dr. Darville said. That\u2019s because chlamydia is a \u201cstealth organism,\u201d producing few symptoms and often going undetected for years.\u201cWe can screen them all and treat them, but if you don\u2019t get all their partners and all their buddies at the other high schools, you have a big spring break party and before you know it everybody\u2019s infected again,\u201d Dr. Darville said. \u201cSo they have this long-term chronic smoldering infection, and they don\u2019t even know it. And then when they\u2019re 28 and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m ready to have a baby, everything\u2019s a mess.\u2019\u201dIn 2019, Dr. Darville and her colleagues received a multiyear, $10.7 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to develop a vaccine. The ideal package would combine a chlamydia and gonorrhea vaccine with the HPV vaccine already given to most preteenagers. \u201cIf we could combine those three, you\u2019d basically have a fertility anticancer vaccine,\u201d she said.Chlamydia\u2019s stealth and ubiquity \u2014 the name means \u201ccloak-like mantle\u201d \u2014 owes to its two-stage life cycle. It starts out as an elementary body, a spore-like structure that sneaks into cells and hides from the body\u2019s immune system. Once inside, it wraps itself in a membrane envelope, hijacks the host cell\u2019s machinery and starts pumping out copies of itself. These copies either burst out of the cell or are released into the bloodstream to continue their journey.ImageDr. Rosemary Booth, director of the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, and a veterinary nurse, Michelle Haywood, examine Merlin, a wild koala with a severe case of chlamydia.Credit...Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times\u201cChlamydia is pretty unique in that regard,\u201d said Ken Beagley, a professor of immunology at Queensland University of Technology and a former colleague of Dr. Timms. \u201cIt\u2019s evolved to survive incredibly well in a particular niche, it doesn\u2019t kill its host and the damage it causes occurs over quite a long time.\u201dThe bacterium can hang out in the genital tract for months or years, wreaking reproductive havoc. Scarring and chronic inflammation can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease. Evidence is mounting that chlamydia harms male fertility as well: Dr. Beagley has found that the bacteria damages sperm and could lead to birth abnormalities.All of this \u2014 except the spring break parties \u2014 is true in both humans and koalas. Researchers who work with both species note that koala chlamydia looks strikingly similar to the human version. The main difference is severity: In koalas, the bacterium rapidly ascends the urogenital tract, and can jump from the reproductive organs to the bladder thanks to their anatomical proximity.These parallels have led Dr. Timms to argue that koalas could serve as a \u201cmissing link\u201d in the search for a human vaccine. \u201cThe koala is more than just a fancy animal model,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually is really useful for human studies.\u201dAn ancient curseNo one knows how or when koalas first got chlamydia. But the curse is at least centuries old.In 1798, European explorers reached the mountains of New South Wales and spied a creature that defied description: ear-tufted and spoon-nosed, it peered down stoically from the crooks of towering eucalyptus trees. They compared it to the wombat, the sloth and the monkey. They settled on \u201cnative bear\u201d and gave it the genus name Phascolarctos (from the Greek for \u201cleather pouch\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d), spawning the misconception that the koala bear is, in fact, a bear.\u201cThe graveness of the visage,\u201d The Sydney Gazette wrote in 1803, \u201cwould seem to indicate a more than ordinary portion of animal sagacity.\u201dIn the late 19th century, the Australian naturalist Ellis Troughton noted that the \u201cquaint and lovable koala\u201d was also particularly susceptible to disease. The animals suffered from an eye ailment similar to pink eye, which he blamed for waves of koala die-offs in the 1890s and 1900s. At the same time, the anatomist J.P. Hill found that koalas from Queensland and New South Wales often had ovaries and uteruses riddled with cysts. Many modern scientists now believe those koalas were probably afflicted with the same scourge: chlamydia.Koalas today have even more to worry about. Dogs, careless drivers and, recently, rampant bushfires have driven their numbers down so far that conservation groups are calling for koalas to be listed as endangered. But chlamydia still reigns supreme: In parts of Queensland, the heart of the epidemic, the disease helped fuel an 80 percent decline over two decades.The disease is also the one that most often sends koalas to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, the country\u2019s busiest wildlife hospital, located 30 miles north of Endeavour. \u201cThe figures are 40 percent chlamydia, 30 percent cars, 10 percent dogs,\u201d said Dr. Rosemary Booth, the hospital\u2019s director. \u201cAnd then the rest is an interesting assortment of what trouble you can get into when you have a small brain and your habitat\u2019s been fragmented.\u201dImageDr. Booth and a colleague inspect Merlin. Chlamydia is the most common reason for a koala to visit the hospital. \u201cThe figures are 40 percent chlamydia, 30 percent cars, 10 percent dogs,\u201d Dr. Booth said.Credit...Russell Shakespeare for The New York TimesDr. Booth\u2019s team treats \u201cchlamydia koalas\u201d with an amped-up regimen of the same antibiotics used on humans. \u201cI get all of my chlamydia information from the C.D.C.,\u201d she said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States, \u201cbecause America is the great center for chlamydia.\u201dBut the cure can be as deadly as the disease. Deep inside a koala\u2019s intestines, an army of bacteria helps the animal subsist off eucalyptus, a plant toxic to every other animal. \u201cThese are the ultimate example of an animal that\u2019s completely dependent on a population of bacteria,\u201d Dr. Booth said. Antibiotics extinguish that crucial gut flora, leaving a koala unable to gain nutrients from its food.In a 2019 trial led by Dr. Timms and Dr. Booth, one of five koalas treated with antibiotics later had to be euthanized \u201cdue to gastrointestinal complications, resulting in muscle wasting and dehydration.\u201d The problem is so dire that vets give antibiotic-treated koalas \u201cpoo shakes\u201d \u2014 fecal transplants, essentially \u2014 in the hopes of restoring their microbiota.For the past decade, Dr. Timms has worked to perfect a vaccine. Rather than treat animals once they are already sick, a widespread vaccine would protect koalas from any future sexual encounter and from passing the infection from mother to newborn. His formula, developed with Dr. Beagley, appears to work well: Trials have shown that it is safe to use and takes effect within 60 days, and that animals show immune responses that span their entire reproductive lives. The next step is optimizing it for use in the field.At Endeavour, the vets treating Jo got a surprise: Molecular tests showed she was chlamydia-free. That meant she could be recruited for the current trial, which is testing a combined vaccine against chlamydia and the koala retrovirus known as KoRV, a virus in the same family as H.I.V. that similarly knocks down the koala\u2019s immune system and makes chlamydia more deadly.Dr. Timms is hoping that this trial and another in New South Wales will be the \u201cclincher\u201d \u2014 the last step before the government rolls out mass vaccinations in northern Australia. If he is right, it could be good news for more than just koalas.Of mice and marsupialsDr. Timms began his career studying chlamydia in livestock before moving on to using mice as a model for a human vaccine. Cheap, plentiful and amenable to genetic manipulation, mice have long been the gold standard for studying reproductive disease.But the mouse model comes with serious drawbacks. Most glaringly, mice exhibit a profoundly different immune response to chlamydia than ours, making the idea of testing a mouse for a human vaccine \u201ccompletely flawed,\u201d Dr. Timms said.After a decade of doing mouse work, he reasoned that he could take the insights he had gleaned and apply them to an animal that was actually suffering and possible to cure: the koala. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a vaccine for mice,\u201d he said. With \u201ckoala work, as hard as that is, and as difficult as that is, the results you get are the ones that matter.\u201dThe more Dr. Timms worked with koalas, the more he realized that these marsupials were not so different from you and I. Here was a species that, like us, was naturally infected with several strains of chlamydia and suffered from similar reproductive outcomes, including infertility. He realized he might have a useful model animal on his hands.ImageMerlin receiving antibiotics, the same ones used to treat human chlamydia. But the cure can be deadly, extinguishing the intestinal bacteria\u00a0that the animals require to digest eucalyptus, their main food source.Credit...Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times\u201cYou\u2019re better off doing a bad experiment in koalas than a good experiment in mice,\u201d Dr. Timms said. \u201cBecause koalas really do get chlamydia and they really do get reproductive tract disease, so everything you do is relevant.\u201dOutside Australia, many researchers say the idea of a koala model is clever but difficult to implement. Dr. Darville pointed out that it would be expensive and logistically impossible to test 30 different vaccines in koalas. (According to Endeavour, it costs roughly $2,000 to pluck one koala from its tree and give it a health exam.)Still, Dr. Timms said, the challenge was worth attempting: \u201cThe reason that we\u2019re making a case that in between mouse and humans you should put koalas \u2014 rather than guinea pigs, minipigs and monkeys \u2014 is that koalas address all of the weaknesses, to some degree, that the others have.\u201dPaola Massari, an immunologist at Tufts Medical School, is collaborating with Dr. Timms to test a different potential vaccine in koalas. \u201cThe koala represents a perfect clinical model, because it\u2019s an animal for which you can do some experimentation that\u2019s a little more than what you can do in humans,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the same time, if you get results, you are curing a disease (in koalas).\u201dAn unlikely allianceOn a hot February afternoon, Dr. Booth strode out into the blaring sunlight of the Australia Zoo grounds. She was heading to the chlamydia wards, which in 2018 were officially named the John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward after a grant was donated on the comedian\u2019s behalf. About 20 sick koalas were being treated with antibiotics that day, with dozens more on the road to recovery.Dr. Booth stepped up to a leafy enclosure, where a fluffy gray female eyed her curiously from her perch. This koala was originally brought in for chlamydia but had since recovered; her reason for being here, listed on her cage, was \u201cmisadventure.\u201dImageMs. Haywood carrying Merlin in to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital on June 24.Credit...Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times\u201cThis is little Lorna, who\u2019s rather interesting,\u201d Dr. Booth said. \u201cShe has a baby in her pouch and she\u2019s had problems with her glucose metabolism\u201d \u2014 she had diabetes.Wasn\u2019t it unusual to have an animal that gets such humanlike diseases: diabetes, cancer and sexually transmitted infections? \u201cWe are but an animal,\u201d Dr. Booth said, throwing her hands up in a gesture of unity with the world. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of it first.\u201dIt is still uncertain to what extent the research on koala chlamydia will help in developing a human vaccine. (Dr. Darville had been working for nine months when Covid-19 hit, shuttering her lab and slowing scientific progress.) What is certain is that the research done on human chlamydia has greatly benefited koalas. From human antibiotics to mouse insights, wildlife veterinarians have far more tools than before to save the vulnerable marsupials.For Dr. Booth, helping koalas is more than enough. \u201cI don\u2019t want to save humans,\u201d she said. \u201cMy emphasis is completely the other way: I want to use human research to help save other animals. Because they don\u2019t have a voice unless we speak for them.\u201d[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/science/windows-street-noise.html", "title": "Scientists Say You Can Cancel the Noise but Keep Your Window Open", "summary": "Researchers in Singapore developed a system that\u2019s sort of like noise-canceling headphones for your whole apartment.", "authors": "By David Waldstein", "text": "Car alarms, jackhammers, a drunken argument and the rumble of the No. 7 train passing overhead. It is the glorious urban symphony that pours into a typical New York City apartment building day and night.Sure, closing the window can help, but there goes your natural ventilation.What if there were technology to cancel the offending clamor, like a pair of giant noise-canceling headphones for your apartment?Researchers in Singapore have developed an apparatus that can be placed in a window to reduce incoming sound by 10 decibels. The system was created by a team of scientists, including Masaharu Nishimura, who came up with the basic concept, and Bhan Lam, a researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\u201cI grew up in Singapore,\u201d Dr. Lam said in a Zoom interview from his apartment there. \u201cIt\u2019s a small city with a lot of noise, so I have some motivation to solve this problem.\u201dTheir results were published on Thursday in Scientific Reports. The prototype is not yet the most practical device in real world conditions, but it points the way toward the development of technologies that may help ease the strain of noisy city living.Borrowing from the same technological principles used in noise-canceling headphones, the team expanded the concept to fit an entire room by placing 24 small speakers in a window. The speakers emit sound waves that correspond to the incoming racket and neutralize it \u2014 or, at least some of it.ImageCredit...NTU SingaporeThe system is based on the frequency of the sound waves and, for now, the optimal range is between 300 and 1,000 hertz.In Singapore, a city near the Equator where temperatures are often high, overlapping transportation systems and the desire for natural ventilation in modern high-rise apartment towers can pose a healthy-living conundrum.Dr. Lam explained that \u201cin places like Singapore, we want to keep the windows open as much as possible\u201d to reduce the use of carbon-intensive air-conditioners and to prevent buildup of stale air that can pose health risks for some people.But with windows open, the constant din from city traffic, trains, jets passing overhead and construction equipment can rattle apartments. The Anti-Noise Control Window, as it is called, is the sonic equivalent of shutting a window.With any sound, the best way to reduce it is at the source, like a gun\u2019s silencer. So the researchers treated the window aperture itself as the noise source, because most noise enters a room that way.The system uses a microphone outside the window to detect the repeating sound waves of the offending noise source, which is registered by a computer controller. That in turn deciphers the proper wave frequency needed to neutralize the sound, which is transmitted to the array of speakers on the inside of the window frame.The speakers then emit the proper \u201canti\u201d waves, which cancel out the incoming waves, and there you have it: near blissful silence.\u201cIf you sit in the room, you get that same feeling like when you flick on the switch of noise-canceling earphones,\u201d Dr. Lam said, splaying his hands to denote the calming effect.The system is best at attenuating the audible blasts from the types of steady noise sources found within the optimal frequency range.Unfortunately, human voices do not fit within most of that range. One of the next hurdles will be to find a way to silence loud conversations from across the way.Another limitation is that the system is not good at neutralizing sporadic noises, like firecrackers, car horns or the occasional earsplitting crash of metal storefront shutters \u2014 the kinds of noises that drive many New Yorkers to slam their windows shut.One reason for the limitation on frequency is the size of the speakers. To cancel out lower frequencies would require larger bass speakers. But those would interfere with ventilation and your ability to see through the window.It\u2019s a trade-off, and one solution might be installing larger windows, or discovering a way to make it work with smaller speakers.As it is, the 24 speakers, each about 2 inches in diameter, are a bit of an aesthetic hindrance.\u201cOne complaint that we get is that it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Dr. Lam said.But if it can neutralize the sound of the jet taking off from Runway 13 at LaGuardia, that is (soft) music to the ears."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/science/astronomy-galaxies-attractor-universe.html", "title": "Beyond the Milky Way, a Galactic Wall", "summary": "Astronomers have discovered a vast assemblage of galaxies hidden behind our own, in the \u201czone of avoidance.\u201d", "authors": "By Dennis Overbye", "text": "Astronomers have discovered that there is a vast wall across the southern border of the local cosmos.The South Pole Wall, as it is known, consists of thousands of galaxies \u2014 beehives of trillions of stars and dark worlds, as well as dust and gas \u2014 aligned in a curtain arcing across at least 700 million light-years of space. It winds behind the dust, gas and stars of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, from the constellation Perseus in the Northern Hemisphere to the constellation Apus in the far south. It is so massive that it perturbs the local expansion of the universe.But don\u2019t bother trying to see it. The entire conglomeration is behind the Milky Way, in what astronomers quaintly call the zone of avoidance.An international team of astronomers led by Daniel Pomar\u00e8de of Paris-Saclay University and R. Brent Tully of the University of Hawaii announced this new addition to the local universe on Friday in a paper in Astrophysical Journal. The paper is festooned with maps and diagrams of blobby and stringy features of our local universe as well as a video tour of the South Pole Wall.It is the latest installment of an ongoing mission to determine where we are in the universe \u2014 to fix our neighborhood among the galaxies and the endless voids \u2014 and where we are going.\u201cThe surprise for us is that this structure is as big as the Sloan Great Wall and twice as close, and remained unnoticed, being hidden in an obscured sector of the southern sky,\u201d Dr. Pomar\u00e8de said in an email.\u201cThe discovery is a wonderful poster child for the power of visualizations in research,\u201d Dr. Tully said.The new wall joins a host of other cosmographic features: arrangements of galaxies, or a lack of them, that astronomers have come to know and love over the last few decades, with names like the Great Wall, the Sloan Great Wall, the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall and the Bootes Void.The new paper was based on measurements, performed by Dr. Tully and his colleagues, of the distances of 18,000 galaxies as far away as 600 million light-years. By comparison, the most distant objects we can see \u2014 quasars and galaxies that formed shortly after the Big Bang \u2014 are about 13 billion light years away.ImageA computer model of the South Pole Wall, with denser areas of matter displayed in red. The entire region shown spans about 1.3 billion light-years; our Milky Way galaxy, barely 100,000 light-years across, is located in the center of the image, where the red and blue arrows originateCredit...Daniel Pomar\u00e8deThe galaxies in the wall cannot be seen, but Dr. Pomar\u00e8de and his colleagues were able to observe their gravitational effects by assembling data from telescopes around the world.In the expanding universe, as described in 1929 by the astronomer Edwin Hubble and confirmed for almost a century, distant galaxies are flying away from us as if they were dots on an inflating balloon; the farther they are, the faster they recede from us, according to a relation called the Hubble law.That motion away from Earth causes their light to be shifted to longer, redder wavelengths and lower frequencies, like retreating ambulance sirens. Astronomers use this \u201credshift,\u201d which is easily measured, as a proxy for relative distance in the universe. By measuring the galaxy distances independently, the \u201cCosmicflows\u201d team, as Dr. Pomar\u00e8de and his colleagues call themselves, was able to distinguish the motion caused by the cosmic expansion from motions caused by gravitational irregularities.As a result, they found that the galaxies between Earth and the South Pole Wall are sailing away from us slightly faster than they otherwise should be, by about 30 miles per second, drawn outward by the enormous blob of matter in the wall. And galaxies beyond the wall are moving outward more slowly than they otherwise should be, reined in by the gravitational drag of the wall.One astonishing aspect of the wall is how big it is compared to the volume that the team was surveying: a contiguous filament of light 1.4 billion light-years long, packed into a cloud maybe 600 million in radius. \u201cThere is hardly room in the volume for anything bigger!\u201d Dr. Tully said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019d have to anticipate that our view of the filament is clipped; that it extends beyond our survey horizon.\u201dAnd yet the South Pole Wall is nearby in cosmological terms. \u201cOne might wonder how such a large and not-so-distant structure remained unnoticed,\u201d Dr. Pomar\u00e8de mused in a statement issued by his university.But in the expanding universe, there is always something more to see.On the largest scales, cosmologists attest, the universe should be expanding smoothly, and the galaxies should be evenly distributed. But on smaller, more local scales, the universe appears lumpy and gnarled. Astronomers have found that galaxies are gathered, often by the thousands, in giant clouds called clusters and that these are connected to one another in lacy, luminous chains and filaments to form superclusters extending across billions of light-years. In between are vast deserts of darkness called voids.From all of this has emerged what some astronomers call our \u201clong address\u201d: We live on Earth, which is in the solar system, which is in the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way is part of a small cluster of galaxies called the Local Group, which is on the edge of the Virgo cluster, a conglomeration of several thousand galaxies.In 2014, Dr. Tully suggested that these features were all connected, as part of a giant conglomeration he called Laniakea \u2014 Hawaiian for \u201copen skies\u201d or \u201cimmense heaven.\u201d It consists of 100,000 galaxies spread across 500 million light-years.All this lumpiness has distorted the expansion of the universe. In 1986, a group of astronomers who called themselves the Seven Samurai announced that the galaxies in a huge swath of the sky in the direction of the constellation Centaurus were flying away much faster than the Hubble law predicted, as if being pulled toward something \u2014 something the astronomers called the Great Attractor. It was the beginning of something big.\u201cWe now see the Great Attractor as the downtown region of the supercluster that we live in \u2014 an overall entity that our team has called the Laniakea Supercluster,\u201d Dr. Tully said. All the different parts of this supercluster are tugging on us, he added.As a result, the Great Attractor and its relatives are shedding light on another enduring cosmic mystery \u2014 namely, where we are headed.Astronomers discovered in 1965 that space is suffused with microwave radiation, a bath of heat \u2014 with a temperature of 2.7 degrees Kelvin, or minus 455 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 left over from the birth of the universe 14 billion years ago. Subsequent observations revealed that this bath is not uniform: It is slightly warmer in one direction, suggesting that we \u2014 Earth, our galaxy and the Local Group \u2014 are moving through the microwaves, like a goldfish in a fishbowl, at about 400 miles per second in the approximate direction of Centaurus, but aiming far beyond.ImageA projection of the South Pole Wall in celestial coordinates. The plane of the Milky Way is shown by a dust map in shades of grey; what lies behind it is obscured from direct observation.Credit...Daniel Pomar\u00e8deWhy? What is over there, on the other side of the fishbowl, compelling us? That is the kind of question that would come up in an Arthur C. Clarke novel, where humanity is always gearing up for some definitive expedition around the curve of the universe.\u201cA major goal in cosmology is to explain this motion,\u201d Dr. Tully said in a series of emails. In theory, the motion arises from the lumpy distribution of matter that grew out of tiny ripples in the density of the early universe.\u201cThe Great Attractor is certainly an important part of the cause of our motion,\u201d Dr. Tully said. \u201cThe South Pole Wall also contributes but, again, only in part,\u201d he added, listing more local galaxy clusters and voids. \u201cEvery hill and valley in the density distribution makes itself felt.\u201dMost of that is stuff that we cannot see directly. According to the prevailing theory of a confoundingly preposterous universe, the cosmos contains about five times as much invisible dark matter as luminous atomic matter.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Nobody knows exactly what dark matter is made of, but according to cosmologists it provides the gravitational scaffolding for the luminous structures in the universe \u2014 galaxies, galaxy clusters, superclusters, voids and chains like the South Pole Wall, all connected by spidery filaments in what\u2019s known as the cosmic web. The visible universe of stars and galaxies, cosmologists like to say, is like snow on mountaintops or lights on dark, distant Christmas trees.But by following the lights and how they are moving, astronomers like Dr. Tully and his cosmographers have now been able to probe the shadows on which they sit: galumphing clouds of mass whose gravity shapes the destiny of the visible cosmos, arranging it into shapes and neighborhoods, walls, valleys and voids.\u201cIt\u2019s just dark matter having its way,\u201d Dr. Tully said.\u201cWe are like swimmers attempting to swim upstream but being carried downstream faster.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/science/sea-squirts-embryos.html", "title": "This Ancient Sea Creature Builds Its Body With a Whisper, Not a Scream", "summary": "Unlike vertebrate embryo cells, which signal to each other over long distances, sea squirt embryo cells talk only to those they\u2019re closest to.", "authors": "By Katherine J. Wu", "text": "Building a body from scratch is a daunting task, one that requires careful coordination among all those involved. That\u2019s why nature\u2019s starting stuff \u2014\u00a0cells \u2014 have learned to be remarkably chatty to get the job done right.Decades of experiments on embryos from fish, frogs and mice have painted a general picture of the way these cellular conversations often go. Cells will emit molecular signals that can diffuse deep into their environment, not unlike messages broadcast over radio waves. Such widely transmitted messages, which direct information to distant anatomical locales, have long been considered essential to the act of building a body.\u201cIt is what is discussed in textbooks,\u201d said L\u00e9o Guignard, a biologist at the Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin.But nature has developed subtler ways of sending messages, too.By eavesdropping on the embryos of sea squirts, saclike filter feeders that inhabit the world\u2019s shallow ocean floors, Dr. Guignard and his colleagues may have identified another way that burgeoning cells correspond. During their earliest days, sea squirt cells seem to exchange signals only with their nearest neighbors, rather than dispatching signals to cells that are farther afield, according to a paper published Thursday in Science.It\u2019s the microscopic equivalent of passing notes between close friends \u2014 a talking tactic that may be more limited in reach than its long-range counterpart, but could allow for the delivery of especially precise instructions.Most researchers in the field of developmental biology \u201chave never really thought about cell signaling in this way,\u201d said Chen Cao, who researches sea squirt development at Princeton University but wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. \u201cThis is a brand-new angle\u201d on how embryo cells find their fates, she said.Sea squirts are more closely related to vertebrates \u2014 animals like humans with backbones \u2014 than you might expect from brainless blobs. And the embryos of some sea squirt species, such as Phallusia mammillata, are completely transparent, making them especially easy to observe.The researchers used a highly sensitive form of microscopy to track 10 Phallusia mammillata embryos during six hours of their early development. Snapping images every two minutes, the cameras recorded the position and shape of each cell in the embryo through multiple rounds of division, until the sea squirts-to-be each contained several hundred cells apiece, about a third of the way through development.VideoCells in a developing sea squirt embryo, with different colors representing the tissues they will form, such as fuchsia for muscles and dark green for the brain. Video by L. GuignardUnlike frog or mouse embryo cells which may zip to and fro during development, young sea squirt cells stayed mostly in place. Mathematical modeling also showed that the cells signaled only to the cells they touched, almost like they were whispering to one another. In at least these early stages of development, sea squirt cells didn\u2019t seem to need long-distance chatter.The findings raise the possibility that \u201cyou can be a whole, sophisticated embryo\u201d by way of local signals alone, said Patrick Lemaire, a developmental biologist at the University of Montpellier in France and a co-author of the study.Remarkably, these patterns repeated themselves in all the sea squirts the team observed, to the point where the same cells occupied nearly identical neighborhoods in different embryos. Dr. Lemaire said he thinks this rigid consistency may have played some role in keeping the squishy forms of sea squirts mostly unchanged since they first appeared on the planet hundreds of millions of years ago.Video\u201cThis is a beautiful piece of work,\u201d said Cassandra Extavour, a developmental biologist at Harvard University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. And though sea squirts are the only creatures in which these developmental patterns have been rigorously documented so far, Dr. Extavour said she expects \u201cthere will be many, many more animals that rely on a signaling principle like the one outlined here.\u201dDifferent types of signaling also aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Dr. Cao said she thinks even sea squirt cells might make some long-distance calls later in development.Scientists have long \u201clooked for a unifying view of how cell-cell communication works across animals,\u201d said Didem Sarikaya, a developmental biologist at the University of California, Davis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that is not the case, Dr. Sarikaya said.\u201cWe tend to observe the things we have already known about before,\u201d Dr. Extavour said. But \u201cif we understand this lens is very narrow, we might not be surprised by findings like this.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/science/saber-tooth-marsupial.html", "title": "How a Saber-Tooth Marsupial Blinded Us With Its Bite", "summary": "The extinct South American animal made us believe it was as fierce as a saber-tooth cat, but a new study suggests it was a mere scavenger.", "authors": "By Matt Kaplan", "text": "Smilodon fatalis has its name for a reason. With swordlike canines, the saber-tooth cat is widely thought to have waited in silence before lunging and dealing devastating wounds to the soft throats of the large animals that it preyed upon. But paleontologists have long believed that this super-ambush predator was not alone in its way of life. A predatory marsupial known as Thylacosmilus also had long blades projecting from its mouth. But new research suggests that this notion is wrong.Thylacosmilus was discovered in Argentina in 1926 when paleontologists excavated a fossil of an animal that looked remarkably similar to Smilodon. It had two main differences from the saber-tooth cat. First, it carried its young in a pouch like a kangaroo. And the canines of Thylacosmilus and Smilodon rested in different places.Instead of having its teeth fully exposed outside of its mouth like Smilodon, Thylacosmilus had flanges formed from its lower jaw. These protrusions of bone functioned somewhat like scabbards, protecting the animal\u2019s canines when its mouth was closed.Beyond these differences, the animals were thought to have filled the same ecological ambush niche. Yet, upon closer examination, Christine Janis of the University of Bristol in England had doubts.After more Thylacosmilus fossils were uncovered in South America, it became clear that the marsupial lacked the upper incisors that sit between the sharp canines. This struck Dr. Janis as strange, because great cats today like lions and jaguars depend on these teeth to get meat off bones. She also knew from previous work conducted by other labs that the canines of Thylacosmilus were structurally different from the teeth of Smilodon because of their triangular shape.\u201cThose big canines had everyone mesmerized, nobody seemed to notice that they were actually shaped like claws rather than blades. We almost named the paper \u2018Blinded by the Tooth,\u2019\u201d Dr. Janis said. These differences raised questions and led her to collaborate with other researchers to conduct a detailed analysis of the ancient marsupial.ImageA Thylacosmilus jaw and its flange.Credit...Larisa DeSantisAfter simulations of skull and tooth performance were run with models of skulls generated from computed tomography, the researchers discovered that the marsupial\u2019s skull was considerably weaker than that of Smilodon and was not robust enough to support a saber-tooth-style stabbing bite.Instead, the simulations suggested that Thylacosmilus was excellent at making the strong pulling actions that are commonly used by scavengers, like hyenas, to rip carcasses apart.The microscopic wear marks on the marsupial\u2019s other teeth were also odd. Rather than showing evidence of biting and chewing bones, as is commonly found in large cats today and seen on the teeth of Smilodon, the teeth of Thylacosmilus show wear marks consistent with a diet of very soft meat, but not bones, similar to what cheetahs eat today.Dr. Janis reported in the journal PeerJ last month that the findings reveal an animal that was definitely not a marsupial version of Smilodon. As for what it was actually doing, she proposes that Thylacosmilus was a scavenger that employed its huge canines to rip carcasses apart and then gobbled up organs.She further suggests that, like walruses and anteaters that lack incisors and have very long tongues, Thylacosmilus slid its tongue into bodies to extract these innards. In essence, she argues it was a specialist organ feeder unlike anything living today.Others in the field are not quite ready to embrace all that Dr. Janis is proposing.\u201cI am willing to entertain the notion that Thylacosmilus was a scavenger, but calling it a specialist organ feeder may be going a bit far,\u201d said Blaire Van Valkenburgh, a paleontologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\u201dThe trouble is with the tongue.\u201cAs I was reading about the missing incisors in the paper, I too thought that maybe these animals had a spectacular tongue with lots of stiff papillae that allowed them to rapidly clean bones of flesh,\u201d Dr. Van Valkenburgh said. Unfortunately, unlike bones, tongues rot away when animals die. \u201cI am not sure how we could ever confirm this.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/science/polynesian-ancestry.html", "title": "Some Polynesians Carry DNA of Ancient Native Americans, New Study Finds", "summary": "A new genetic study suggests that Polynesians made an epic voyage to South America 800 years ago.", "authors": "By Carl Zimmer", "text": "About 3,000 years ago, people on the eastern edge of Asia began sailing east, crossing thousands of miles of ocean to reach uninhabited islands.

The two astronauts are in orbit working on experiments and maintenance of the space station and will attempt a return trip in the SpaceX vessel later this year.If Boeing\u2019s December test flight of its spacecraft, called Starliner, had gone as planned, a demonstration flight with two astronauts aboard similar to Mr. Behnken and Mr. Hurley\u2019s voyage would most likely have occurred by now.Instead, Boeing will now repeat the uncrewed test, perhaps late this year, with a crewed flight delayed until next year.In addition to an investigation of what went wrong technically, NASA officials also declared what is known as \u201chigh visibility close call\u201d to examine whether there were any blind spots within NASA that led to its overlooking Boeing\u2019s issues.Kathy Lueders, who was recently appointed associate administrator of the agency\u2019s human exploration and operations directorate, said that NASA, as part of efforts to reduce costly bureaucratic overhead, had not asked Boeing or SpaceX for a high-level management plan for how complex pieces of engineering would be put together and tested.But that lack of knowledge meant that NASA did not fully understand how Boeing was designing the Starliner\u2019s software and the testing process for verifying that it would work as intended. \u201cWe thought we understood it, but we ended up finding out that over time, that kind of changed,\u201d Ms. Lueders said.She also said that for the December test flight, NASA had focused on the highest priorities, in particular ensuring that Starliner did not pose any danger to the space station as it approached, and that might have caused software engineering to receive less attention.\u201cWhere do you apply the resources to make sure that you\u2019re getting kind of the biggest bang for your buck, to be able to really flesh out where you have problems in your systems?\u201d she said.NASA is now overseeing software development more closely at both SpaceX and Boeing.The Starliner spacecraft, launched on top of an Atlas 5 rocket on Dec. 20, encountered two major software problems during its flight. The first occurred minutes after the spacecraft had separated from the rocket, because the capsule\u2019s clock had been set wrong. That caused the spacecraft to squander its propellant, and a planned docking at the International Space Station was called off.Starliner also experienced a communications problem that prevented mission controllers from quickly regaining control. An investigation revealed that the spacecraft\u2019s radio receiver had been listening to too wide a swath of frequencies, which led to interference from other transmissions from Earth. Boeing engineers have added a filter to limit the frequencies.The second software flaw would have fired the wrong thrusters as Starliner was preparing for re-entry. As Boeing engineers hastily combed through the Starliner software in the aftermath of the clock problem, they found that problem and fixed it. If it had not been fixed, two pieces of Starliner \u2014 the capsule that returns to Earth and the service module, which is discarded \u2014 might have collided. The capsule might have tumbled and burned up in the atmosphere instead of landing safely in White Sands, N.M.A review panel made 80 recommendations that Boeing is working to implement before the next uncrewed test flight."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/science/spirit-bears-canada.html", "title": "Hair From Ghostly Bears Reveals New Genetic Secrets", "summary": "First Nations peoples along British Columbia\u2019s Central Coast led research to help preserve the area\u2019s white-furred Spirit bears.", "authors": "By Lesley Evans Ogden", "text": "Douglas Neasloss was skeptical that Spirit bears existed. A member of the Kitasoo/Xai\u2019xais First Nation in Canada, he had heard the stories of white-furred bears that roamed British Columbia\u2019s rainforest. But Mr. Neasloss, a former tour leader and cultural interpreter, had never seen one until 2005, when he experienced \u201cone of the most magical moments\u201d of his guiding career. During a hike, he caught sight of a cinnamon-tinged white bear as it walked out ahead of him, then lay down 50 feet away to munch on a freshly caught salmon.After his first Spirit bear encounter, Mr. Neasloss asked community elders why these bears weren\u2019t widely discussed. During the fur trade of the 1800s, he learned, existence of the ghostly bears was kept secret to keep them safe. Today, they are the official mammal of British Columbia, and known also as the Kermode bear.And now that the secret is out, coastal peoples, including the Kitasoo/Xai\u2019xais and Gitga\u2019at Nations, are determined to preserve the bears\u2019 uniqueness. That\u2019s part of what motivated Indigenous-led research, co-authored by Mr. Neasloss, who is now resource stewardship director for his Nation. The study, published Sunday in Ecological Solutions and Evidence, suggests that the gene that turns the coat of these Spirit bears ghostly white is rarer than previously estimated, and that their habitat in the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada is not yet adequately protected.Though culturally significant to First Nations, scientific understanding of these bears is in its infancy. And ecotourism, including viewing bears, now drives employment and revenue along British Columbia\u2019s Central Coast, where the largest tract of intact temperate rainforest left on the planet was partially protected in a 2016 agreement designating the Great Bear Rainforest. The Kitasoo/Xai\u2019xais and Gitga\u2019at Nations have spearheaded a collaboration with scientists to better understand the prevalence of Spirit bear genes, while also probing how well Spirit bear hot spots are protected.ImageSpirit bears are not albinos, but born with the same genetic quirk that causes red hair in humans.Credit...Cael CookTaking the pulse of this rare bear in a remote, mountainous, boggy and largely roadless rainforest archipelago is no easy task. Previous studies had largely confined sampling to areas like river mouths where bears were already known to occur. But Mr. Neasloss and his colleagues, including Christina Service, a bear scientist with the University of Victoria and the Kitasoo/Xai\u2019xais Stewardship Authority, cast the net wider, undertaking noninvasive sampling of DNA from bear hair collected across a vast region.Bear hair snagging involved a corral of barbed wire erected around a smelly lure: a gray oily sludge made from odor-enhanced fish fertilizer.\u201cAbsolutely repulsive to us, very delectable to bears,\u201d Dr. Service said.Though snagging bear hair on barbed wire might sound painful, it\u2019s not. In the spring, bears are happy to rub against anything that helps them shed some of their thick winter coats, making for a convenient, culturally respectful sampling method that does not require the capture and tranquilizing of bears.Snagged hair tells many stories. From it, researchers can discern a bear\u2019s species, sex, stress level, food preferences and \u2014 central to this study \u2014 whether it\u2019s a carrier of the coat-lightening Spirit bear gene.Spirit bears, though whitish, are not albinos.\u201cAlbinism affects all the pigment cells in the whole body,\u201d while Spirit bears typically have black feet and slightly orange fur, said Kermit Ritland, a geneticist at the University of British Columbia. In 2001, he and collaborators identified the gene responsible for the Spirit bear\u2019s white coat. It\u2019s the same genetic quirk that causes red hair in humans, and auburn fur in dogs and mice. Spirit bears can be born to parents that may or may not have white fur themselves. For example, a mama and papa black bear each carrying one copy of the recessive gene can produce a white-furred baby.ImageThe frequency of the gene variant that causes the snowy coats was half as common as previous studies estimated.Credit...Doug NeaslossThe researchers mapped the bear genetics using hair from 385 bears snagged at over a hundred evenly spaced high- and low-elevation sites on First Nations territories, during May and June from 2012 to 2017. They found that in some places previously known to be hot spots for Spirit bears, the frequency of the gene variant that causes the snowy coats was half as common as previous studies estimated.They could not say whether the finding reflects changes over time, versus different sampling designs. But it is clear from the new data that the Spirit bear gene variant, while rare, is more widely distributed across the landscape than previously documented. And, by overlaying the geography of the gene\u2019s occurrence with protected areas, the researchers found that many Spirit bear hot spots are not yet adequately protected from habitat loss from logging. Current protected areas have \u201cmissed the mark,\u201d Mr. Neasloss said.Dr. Ritland welcomed the new estimates of Spirit bear gene frequencies, which provide a useful view of their prevalence over a wider range. He questioned the new study\u2019s suggestions about the evolutionary forces that maintain Spirit bear genes, which run counter to his own conclusions, but he commended the wide-ranging sampling and the lead role taken by First Nations researchers.In Kitasoo/Xai\u2019xais culture, bears are considered closely related to humans. Bear and human diets of berries, plants and fish are very similar. In his culture\u2019s stories, Mr. Neasloss said, the bears \u201ctaught us how to survive off the land.\u201dNow the bears\u2019 hairy, high-tech teachings suggest that a thriving ecotourism economy requires the survival of more intact land for bears."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/science/elephants-dead-botswana.html", "title": "356 Elephants Died Suddenly. The Cause Is a Mystery.", "summary": "Some conservationists say the recent die-off in Botswana could be natural, but others expressed more concern.", "authors": "By Rachel Nuwer", "text": "On May 25, conservationists were flying over Botswana\u2019s Okavango Panhandle when they counted something disturbing: 169 dead elephants. A second flight in June revealed more carcasses, bringing the total to 356. Some of the animals appeared to have died suddenly, collapsing chest-first while walking or running. No tusks were removed, suggesting that poaching for ivory may not be to blame.But experts are left with few clues as to whether the cause is something sinister, such as poisonings, or a naturally occurring disease from which the area\u2019s elephants will bounce back.\u201cAs elephant populations grow, it is more likely that you will get mass die-offs, probably on a bigger scale than this,\u201d said Chris Thouless, the head of research at Save the Elephants, a Kenya-based conservation organization. \u201cDeath is no fun, but it comes to all living things.\u201dBut other conservationists expressed more concern.\u201cIn Botswana, there is a huge crisis for elephants unfolding,\u201d said Mark Hiley, the director of rescue operations at National Park Rescue, a nonprofit organization based in Britain that combats poaching in Africa. \u201cThe most important thing now is for an independent team to visit the area \u2014 sample multiple carcasses, the soil and waterways \u2014 and identify what is causing the deaths.\u201dResearchers from Elephants Without Borders, the conservation group in Botswana that conducted the flights documenting the problem, observed some live elephants that appeared to be disoriented, including one that was walking in circles. Others were dragging their hind legs, as though paralyzed, and still others appeared lethargic and emaciated. Males and females, young and old, all seem equally affected.Botswana is home to around 130,000 savanna elephants, or about one-third of the world\u2019s remaining population. Although there are some signs that elephant and rhino poaching may be picking up there, many conservationists still consider the country a critical safe haven for elephants.In a report submitted to government officials, Elephants Without Borders estimated that the spate of mysterious deaths began at least as far back as March. The total number of dead elephants almost certainly exceeds 356, the authors write, because their flights did not cover the entire affected area.Some conservationists say the country\u2019s government is not taking the deaths seriously enough. Officials collected samples from dead elephants for testing in May, but they have not yet released results.\u201cThis started months ago, and by now, the government should be able to tell everyone clearly what this is,\u201d Mr. Hiley said. \u201cThere are plenty of reputable laboratories that could have come up with a result by now.\u201dThe delays in testing could \u201cliterally be killing elephants,\u201d Mr. Hiley added.Dr. Mmadi Reuben, the principal veterinary officer at Botswana\u2019s Department of Wildlife and National Parks, said the government is taking the deaths seriously and responded \u201cswiftly, adequately and responsibly \u2014 as soon as we received this information.\u201dHe said that some testing has ruled out common causes like anthrax, which is caused by bacteria that occur naturally in soil. He and his colleagues are now working with labs in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Canada to perform further testing. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a one-off thing where we say, \u2018We\u2019ve sent out samples, now we\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d Dr. Reuben said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing dialogue with different labs.\u201dThere is still no evidence that the deaths are foul play by humans, he added.Cyanide, which poachers sometimes use to poison elephants, seems unlikely, because carcasses tend to be clumped together near where the poison was deployed. It also tends to kill other animals, but no other species seem to be affected in this case. However, it\u2019s possible that other poisons could be used against elephants, and Mr. Hiley says some of them can dissipate quickly.Covid-19, he added, is unlikely, because the disease has yet to infect people in Okavango\u2019s remote communities. There is also no evidence yet that elephants can contract the virus.Dr. Thouless suspects that a naturally occurring disease is the most likely culprit. One leading candidate is encephalomyocarditis, a viral infection that can be transmitted by rodents, which can cause neurological symptoms. It killed around 60 elephants in South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park in the mid-1990s. Botswana also recently emerged from a drought, which could have left some elephants stressed and more vulnerable to disease, Dr. Thouless said.At this point, he continued, the deaths do not constitute a conservation crisis, because the numbers documented so far represent a small percentage of the 15,000 to 20,000 elephants that live in the Okavango Panhandle. \u201cThis is distressing, but it\u2019s currently trivial in population terms,\u201d he said.Past examples also show that when conditions are favorable, elephants can quickly rebound. For example, in 1970 and 1971, a drought in Tsavo East National Park in Kenya killed an estimated 5,900 of the park\u2019s 35,000 elephants. By 1973, the population was back to 35,000.\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to how much interfering with nature is worth doing,\u201d Dr. Thouless said. \u201cYou can go to an enormous amount of effort without actually achieving anything different in conservation terms.\u201d"}, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/science/venom-amphibians-snakes.html", "title": "It\u2019s Not a Snake, but Beware of Its Venomous Bite", "summary": "Animals called caecilians may have been among the first vertebrates on land to lace their bites with venom.", "authors": "By Katherine J. Wu", "text": "If a worm and a snake had a slimy, scandalous love child, it might look something like a caecilian: a legless creature that\u2019s actually neither worm nor snake, but a soil-dwelling amphibian found in tropics across the globe.Content to spend most of their time beneath the forest floor, caecilians are elusive and poorly understood. Which is why Carlos Jared, a biologist at the Butantan Institute in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, has spent a good part of the last three decades hot on their trail.Bagging a caecilian specimen, he said, often takes hours of laborious digging, carefully executed so a poorly aimed shovel doesn\u2019t cleave the creature in two. Once a specimen is spotted, \u201cyou have to jump on it,\u201d Dr. Jared said, and then wrestle the wriggly amphibian \u2014 which, depending on the species, can range in length from a couple inches to five feet \u2014 into a sack. Many caecilians have squirmed out of Dr. Jared\u2019s grasp at the last moment, gleefully greased by a gelatinous goo that oozes out of their skin.But Dr. Jared said the animals\u2019 fascinating and sometimes baffling biology makes the incessant chasing more than worth it. His team\u2019s latest discovery, published Friday in iScience, shows caecilians\u2019 mouths might be rimmed by venom-tipped teeth, not unlike those found in some snakes.The discovery would mark the first time venom glands have been found in the mouth of an amphibian \u2014 one whose evolutionary history predates the appearance of snakes by more than 100 million years. That could make little-known caecilians among the oldest venomous biters on Earth.Like most other amphibians, caecilians have long been thought to produce only poisons, which, unlike venoms, aren\u2019t actively injected into other creatures. So Pedro Luiz Mailho-Fontana, a postdoctoral scholar working with Dr. Jared, was baffled when he discovered a series of fluid-filled ducts lining the teeth of a ringed caecilian specimen in the lab. \u201cThis is a very different thing here,\u201d he recalled thinking.After searching the mouths of newly hatched caecilians, Dr. Mailho-Fontana determined that the tooth-cradling glands grow out of the same tissue that gives rise to teeth.Dental tissue also happens to be the point of origin for venom glands in snakes, which could help explain the purpose of the newfound ducts, Dr. Jared said. Without legs or arms to parry with predators or prey, animals like snakes and caecilians must rely heavily on their heads.ImageThis image shows the head with the skin partially removed to show the tooth-related glands around the lips.Credit...Carlos JaredCaecilians, like some snakes, are equipped with impressive teeth, and can get pretty \u201cbitey,\u201d said Emma Sherratt, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Adelaide who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.If caecilians also pack a venomous bite, they may have independently stumbled upon a strategy that\u2019s worked out well for many snakes. That would be \u201creally interesting and remarkable,\u201d said Shab Mohammadi, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Perhaps limblessness is an important impetus for the evolution of tooth-borne toxins.But Dr. Mohammadi also noted that it\u2019s still unclear how noxious the glands\u2019 contents are, or how toxic they are to the insects and worms that caecilians nosh on. Dr. Jared and his team have yet to do an in-depth chemical analysis of the caecilian\u2019s glandular goop, though early tests show it\u2019s full of a protein that\u2019s also present in venoms from insects and snakes. Caecilians\u2019 mouths seem to teem with slime at mealtimes, but the secretions have proven to be stubbornly viscous and tough to extract, Dr. Mailho-Fontana said.The researchers are also unsure how widespread venom glands are among caecilian species, which currently number more than 200 (with many more likely unknown). If the ducts are found in ancient lineages, it could indicate that caecilians were among the first land-living vertebrates to lace their bites with venom.Dr. Jared\u2019s team is planning to snag a few more specimens, but even once they manage to get them, it won\u2019t be easy.A few years ago, during a visit to a collaborator\u2019s lab in London, Marta Maria Antoniazzi, a co-author of the study also of the Butantan Institute, picked up a tiny caecilian that promptly sank its teeth into her hand.\u201cIt hurt a lot,\u201d she said.And the wound took a surprisingly long time to close up. Now, Dr. Antoniazzi wonders if she was an unwitting victim of venom.\u201cAt the time, we couldn\u2019t have even imagined,\u201d she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/science/sparrow-bird-song.html", "title": "Canada\u2019s Sparrows Are Singing a New Song.

It even has its own mnemonic, \u201cOld Sam Peabody-Peabody-Peabody.\u201dThe sparrow\u2019s old tripletHear that \u201cOld Sam Peabody-Peabody-Peabody\u201d sound?But over the past half-century, the song\u2019s hook \u2014 its triplet ending \u2014 has changed, replaced by a new, doublet-ended variant, according to a paper published Thursday in Current Biology. It seems the sparrows want to sing something new.The study, which took 20 years, is \u201cthe first to track the cultural evolution of birdsong at the continental scale,\u201d said Mason Youngblood, a doctoral candidate in animal behavior at the CUNY Graduate Center who was not involved in the research. It describes a much broader and more rapid shift in birdsong than was previously thought to occur.Scott Ramsay, a behavioral ecologist at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, was the first to notice that the forest sounded a little off during a visit to western Canada with Ken Otter, a professor at the University of Northern British Columbia.\u201cHe said, \u2018Your birds are singing something weird,\u2019\u201d Dr. Otter recalled.Dr. Otter recorded some white-throated sparrow songs and turned them into spectrograms \u2014 visualizations that lay birdsongs out, so they can be more easily compared. The classic \u201cOld Sam Peabody-Peabody-Peabody\u201d songs ended in a triplet pattern: repeated sets of three notes. The new songs ended in doublets, like the record got stuck: \u201cOld Sam Peabuh-Peabuh-Peabuh-Peabuh.\u201dIt was \u201ca different kind of syncopation pattern,\u201d Dr. Otter said. \u201cThey were kind of stuttering it.\u201dListen to the new sparrow doubletMore like \u201cOld Sam Peabuh, Peabuh, Peabuh.\u201dLike many birds, male white-throated sparrows use songs to signal where their territory is, and to attract mates. Each individual sparrow has his own way of starting the song, but they all converge on a shared ending.But as in the human world, those who mix novelty with familiarity occasionally find success, and their new song circulates through a particular community.Usually, it stays there, and Dr. Otter and his colleagues figured this was happening only with their birds in western Canada, that \u201cit was just an isolated, peripheral population\u201d doing their own thing, he said.When they tried to figure out where the song\u2019s range ended, though, they realized birds were singing the song in other areas, too. In 2004, half the birds the researchers recorded in Alberta were singing doublets instead of triplets. By 2014, they all were, \u201cand it was starting to show up as far east as Ontario,\u201d Dr. Otter said.To get a better sense of the spread, the researchers turned to citizen science birdsong databases. They pulled white-throated sparrow songs from across Canada and the northern United States, and plotted them over time and according to song type. In maps, you can see the doublet song gain prominence, its influence expanding and strengthening. By 2019, it had taken over completely from the Yukon to Ottawa, a certified hit that is currently encroaching on the Northeastern United States.By tracking the western Canadian birds with geolocators, they found that some of them spend their winters in the southern United States, where they overlap with birds from other places. They\u2019re probably sharing the song there, like a mixtape being passed around.The possibility that the birds are swapping songs on their wintering grounds \u201creally opens up how we think of song learning,\u201d said Dana Moseley, an ecologist at James Madison University in Virginia who was not involved in the study. It\u2019s also evidence that where birds \u201cwinter, where they stop over in migration, and where they breed shapes their behavior,\u201d she said.For a song to take off like this is highly unusual, said Dr. Otter. It goes against prevailing birdsong theories, which emphasize the benefits of sticking to your own local song type. What\u2019s happening with the sparrows is \u201ckind of like an Australian person coming to New York, and all the New Yorkers start suddenly deciding to adopt an Australian accent,\u201d he said.It\u2019s unclear why the doublets are so popular. Dr. Otter and his colleagues think it has to do with the female sparrows, who may enjoy a little novelty.Donald Kroodsma, a birdsong expert who was not involved in the study, agreed, pointing to previous work showing that certain populations of chestnut-sided warblers shuffle rapidly through songs that have to do with mating, while keeping fight songs mostly the same. \u201cThe speculations by the authors are appropriate, it would seem,\u201d said Dr. Kroodsma. \u201cBut only the birds know.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/science/flying-snakes-physics.html", "title": "How Do Flying Snakes Glide Through the Air? \u2018It\u2019s Hard to Believe\u2019", "summary": "As they wiggle and undulate, the snakes are transforming their bodies for flight.", "authors": "By David Waldstein", "text": "Jake Socha is an expert on flying snakes who uses detailed scientific terminology such as \u201cthis big, wiggly, ribbon thing\u201d to describe his soaring quarry.It is an apt description, but don\u2019t be fooled. When a snake launches off a tree in its Southeast Asian habitat and lands on another tree dozens of feet away, there is nothing random about those wiggles.A professor of biomedical engineering and mechanics at Virginia Tech, Dr. Socha and his colleagues published a study on Monday in Nature Physics supporting the hypothesis that the midair undulations (the wiggles) are actually carefully coordinated and highly functional processes that enhance the dynamic stability of the snake in flight.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say all the mysteries are solved,\u201d Dr. Socha said, \u201cbut we have a big piece of the story filled in.\u201dFlying is a bit of a misnomer for what the snakes do. The slithering airborne creatures tend to fall strategically or glide, meaning they do not gain altitude like a bird or an insect. Their flights generally last only a couple of seconds, at a speed of around 25 miles per hour, and they land without injury. To the untrained eye, it might look as if the snake just fell out of a tree by accident, wiggling frantically as it plummets to earth. Not so.Once it goes airborne \u2014 after inching out on a tree limb and pushing off the branch \u2014 the snake moves its ribs and muscles to extend the width of its underside, transforming its body into a structure that redirects airflow like a parachute or a wing. A cross section of the snake\u2019s body midair would show that its normal circular shape becomes triangular and the whole body undulates as it glides toward its target.Once in Singapore, Dr. Socha and a group of researchers witnessed a snake jump from 30 feet up and travel over 60 feet in the air on a windless day.\u201cIt was like an athlete hitting its stride,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m off and you\u2019ll never see me again.\u2019\u201dFor years Dr. Socha wondered if the undulations were functional for flight or whether the snakes were simply repeating the same motion in air that they use to move across land and through water.VideoA snake\u2019s flight at 10 percent of its actual speed. Video by Yeaton et al.The researchers, including Isaac Yeaton, a doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering, took about a half-dozen flying snakes to a four-story, black-box cube on the Virginia Tech campus. The cube, which can be used for student projects and experiments in arts, science and engineering, is equipped with a high-speed, motion-capture camera system. The researchers attached infrared reflective tape to the snakes, and fashioned a high tower with a launching branch and a lower tower disguised as a tree for a landing spot. Then they let the snakes fly.Mr. Yeaton, who was once surprised when one of the snakes landed in his arms as he stood on the floor, said they observed over 150 flights of Chrysopelea paradisi \u2014 one of five kinds of flying snakes \u2014 during a week in 2015.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe a snake can do this,\u201d Mr. Yeaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary. But there\u2019s a lot of intricate things that are going on.\u201dThe researchers collected the data and then created three-dimensional computer models to show every angle of the snake in flight.VideoA 3-D model of a snake\u2019s flight, showing top, side and rear views. Video by Yeaton et al.The models illustrated that the undulations contain vertical waves as well as horizontal. And the waves flow proportionally, with the vertical waves twice the frequency of the horizontal waves.They also found that the back end of the snake moved up and down vertically along what they called the dorsoventral axis, adding to its up-and-down or pitch stability.\u201cOther animals undulate for propulsion,\u201d Mr. Yeaton said. \u201cWe show that flying snakes undulate for stability.\u201dUsing the computer models, the researchers could also eliminate some or all of the undulations for comparison. Without them, the snake falls haphazardly and dangerously, like a Frisbee that is thrown without spin.The information from the study, the researchers said, could have applications for robotics, particularly in search and rescue.

If you slice one of the tiny flatworms in half, the halves will grow back, giving you two identical worms. Cut a flatworm\u2019s head in two, and it will grow two heads. Cut an eye off a flatworm \u2014 it will grow back. Stick an eye on a flatworm that lacks eyes \u2014 it\u2019ll take root. Pieces as small as one-279th of a flatworm will turn into new, whole flatworms, given the time.This process of regeneration has fascinated scientists for more than 200 years, prompting myriad zany, if somewhat macabre, experiments to understand how it is possible for a complex organism to rebuild itself from scratch, over and over and over again. In a paper published Friday in Science, researchers revealed a tantalizing glimpse into how the worms\u2019 nervous systems manage this feat.Specialized cells, the scientists report, point the way for neurons stretching from newly grown eyes to the brain of the worm, helping them connect correctly. The research suggests that cellular guides hidden throughout the planarian body may make it possible for the worm\u2019s newly grown neurons to retrace their steps. Gathering these and other insights from the study of flatworms may someday help scientists interested in helping humans regenerate injured neurons.Mar\u00eda Lucila Scimone, a researcher at M.I.T.\u2019s Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, first noticed these cells while studying Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian common to bodies of freshwater in Southern Europe and North Africa. During another experiment, she noted that they were expressing a gene involved in regeneration.\u201cIn every animal she looked at, she\u2019d see just a couple of these, right next to the eye,\u201d said Peter Reddien, a professor of biology at M.I.T. and also an author of the paper.ImageAn example of a freshwater planarian, Dugesia lugubris.Credit...Dr. Keith Wheeler/Science SourceThe team looked more closely and realized that some of the regeneration-related cells were positioned at key branching points in the network of nerves between the worms\u2019 eyes and their brains. When the researchers transplanted an eye from one animal to another, the neurons growing from the new eye always grew toward these cells. When the nerve cells reached their target, they kept growing along the route that would take them to the brain. Removing those cells meant the neurons got lost and did not reach the brain.The cells seemed to be acting as guides of some kind. Guidepost cells that point the way for other cells play important roles in embryo development in many creatures, Dr. Reddien said. But by the time most animals grow into adults, these cells are usually long-gone.In flatworms, however, cells that perform this guiding role apparently exist in adults. They probably arrange themselves along the route from eye to brain using signals from muscle cells that tell them precisely where they should be in the body, Dr. Reddien said.Scientists and doctors have long lusted after the regenerative powers of flatworms \u2014 not precisely with the goal of growing new heads, but of healing spinal cord damage and other serious injuries. Getting the right cells to grow to replace those lost is only part of the process, though.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve come to appreciate in this work is that the rewiring challenge could be a big one,\u201d Dr. Reddien said. Ensuring that transplanted neurons wire themselves up correctly may be another important step.In flatworms, Dr. Reddien and his colleagues are planning to continue looking for cells that give regenerating neurons a guide to follow.\u201cAre there guidepost-like cells in other parts of the nervous system?\u201d he asked.

For a small creature with delicate wings, airborne seeds, shifting leaves and lurching flowers are basically projectiles, trap doors and Godzilla-tipped skyscrapers.It\u2019s a situation honeybees and other pollinators deal with daily as they gather nectar and pollen. But although researchers have looked into how bees navigate on blustery days, or through tight spaces, \u201cno one has really pieced together how they move through moving obstacles in wind,\u201d said Nicholas Burnett, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis.In a study published this month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, Dr. Burnett and colleagues addressed this gap \u2014 and found that when the going is tough, honeybees appear to high-tail it and hope for the best.For the study, the researchers built a bee obstacle course. They spaced four rods an inch and a half apart on an oscillating platform that could move them back and forth, like swaying stems. They then put the whole setup inside a flight tunnel, with a fan on either end.VideoIn this case, a bee slowed down and steered its way around the moving obstacles without trouble. Video by Burnett et al.Honeybee volunteers were recruited from around campus. The researchers had them fly through the course one at a time, in various conditions \u2014 in still air, against a headwind, and propelled by a tailwind, and with either stationary or moving obstacles \u2014 and filmed their efforts with a high-speed video camera. The bees were then sent home again, unfortunately without prizes.When they went to the tape, the researchers found that the bees\u2019 flight strategy changed depending on the conditions they faced. When confronted with moving rods in still air, they flew more slowly than when they encountered stationary obstacles.\u201cYou might interpret that as them being more cautious, because there\u2019s this unexpected thing happening in front of them,\u201d Dr. Burnett said. (In nature, quivering vegetation on a still day might indicate the presence of a predator, or a lawn mower.)But when the wind kicked up \u2014 in either direction \u2014 the honeybees would \u201cactually speed up how fast they\u2019re flying\u201d by about 50 percent when the rods were moving compared with when they were still, he said.When faced with complex airspace, the bees seemed to act \u201ccautious in still air and courageous in wind,\u201d he said.VideoBut the bee\u2019s transit through the moving obstacles at its regular flying speed led to an occasional bonk. Video by Burnett et al.The study underscores that animals, including honeybees, are actually complex decision makers \u2014 \u201cnot one-trick ponies,\u201d said Glenna Clifton, an assistant professor at the University of Portland who studies insect locomotion and was not involved in the study. In addition to wind, \u201cthere are numerous other factors that likely also play a role\u201d in their flight choices, including light level, time of day and food abundance.As for what accounts for these differing strategies, Dr. Burnett hypothesizes that it might be the same force that makes us run through rainstorms: the need to \u201cget through the obstacles as fast as possible,\u201d he said. This idea was underscored by further analysis, which focused on how successful bees managed to avoid collisions. In still air, slowing down was helpful. But in wind, speed didn\u2019t matter, and a wipeout-free transit was determined by how well the bees aimed themselves as they flew through the rods.That honeybees are using a \u201cgrin-and-sprint-through-it strategy\u201d is an intriguing hypothesis, Dr. Clifton said, adding that she would like to see further study focused on whether there was a moment when the bees decided to accelerate.It also reminded her of human competitors on obstacle-course reality TV shows.\u201cIf you watch those shows, there are interesting moments when someone who is being cautious and deliberate figuratively throws their arms up, hopes for the best, and just goes for it,\u201d she said. Sometimes that\u2019s the most effective strategy."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/health/organ-transplants-lungs.html", "title": "In Astounding Test, Scientists Revive Damaged Lungs for Transplant", "summary": "Injured and unusable lungs were restored with respirators and pig blood. The procedure one day may increase the supply of organs for transplant.", "authors": "By Gina Kolata", "text": "The six lungs were taken from brain-dead patients and offered to transplant surgeons. But at major medical centers, one surgeon after another refused the organs.They were damaged, swollen and soggy with fluid. Like 80 percent of lungs offered for transplant, these were just too far gone for the operation.But researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt saw an opportunity. They had been working for eight years on a system to restore damaged lungs.They put each lung in a plastic box and attached it to a respirator so it could \u201cbreathe.\u201d Then they connected each lung to a large vein in the neck of a live pig, so that its blood flowed through the vessels.The results, reported on Monday in Nature Medicine, seem like pure science fiction: Within 24 hours, the lungs looked viable, and lab tests confirmed they had been resuscitated.Now the researchers are considering using a human instead of a pig. They would hook a damaged lung to the patient with a large catheter inserted in the patient\u2019s neck, and attach the lung to a respirator in the room. The transplant patient waiting for a lung could resuscitate one for himself. The procedure is nowhere near ready for routine use. But others not associated with the research said they were impressed.\u201cWould I consider doing this? Absolutely,\u201d said Dr. Zachary N. Kon, the surgical director of the lung transplant center at New York University Langone Medical Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformative idea that would allow a jump forward in the field.\u201dDr. David W. Roe, a lung transplant surgeon at Indiana University, said: \u201cThis is all on the outer cusp, but I don\u2019t think it is out of the realm of possibility. It all makes sense.\u201dThere is an urgent need for more lungs for transplant. Although 2,562 lung transplants were performed in the United States in 2018, 3,134 patients were added to the waiting list. Some 365 patients died while waiting for a lung, or became too sick to have the operation. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to increase the need. Severely ill patients may suffer lasting lung damage; the first such patient to receive a double lung transplant was reported in June. If there were a way to use even 40 percent of donated lungs for transplant, instead of the current 20 percent, the waiting list for lungs could be eliminated, said Dr. Matthew D. Bacchetta, a lung transplant surgeon at Vanderbilt and a lead author of the new paper.Eligibility criteria for a lung transplant are very strict because the supply is so limited. Most medical centers rule out patients age 70 or older, as well as people who are frail, even if they are teenagers whose frailty is caused by failing lungs.\u201cIf we could expand the donor pool,\u201d Dr. Bacchetta said, \u201cwe could avoid a lot of waiting-list deaths and could be more open-minded about who could have a transplant.\u201dVideoA time-lapse video showing three pairs of donor lungs being rehabilitated with the cross-circulation process.CreditPatients might also get lung transplants while they were still relatively healthy, he added. As it stands now, \u201cif you are very sick going into a transplant, chances are you will be very sick going out,\u201d Dr. Bacchetta said.The project began when surgeons at Columbia paid a visit to Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, who directs the university\u2019s laboratory for stem cells and tissue engineering, to talk about making more lungs for transplant patients.She knew that lungs are gas-exchange organs with a surface area about the size of a tennis court. The organs are much more sensitive than other organs to damage and deterioration.Injured lungs easily fill with fluid and then start to break down. The fluids leak into airways, leaving lungs wet and heavy, like soaked sponges.Doctors sometimes give diuretics to brain-dead donors to encourage urination, in an effort to dry out their lungs in preparation for transplant into other patients. The strategy does not often succeed.At first, Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic\u2019s group and those at other medical centers tried to bioengineer lungs from scratch. Some groups removed all of the cells from lungs, leaving a scaffold that they seeded with cells.\u201cIt looked very cool, but it was leaky,\u201d Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic said. \u201cThis caused a massive loss of blood.\u201d\u201cThis was telling us that, unlike other tissues, you cannot make a lung in the lab,\u201d she added.But then a group of researchers at the University of Toronto discovered a way to rescue some lungs. By pumping a clear nutrient fluid into damaged lungs and hooking the organs to a ventilator, the scientists were able to restore some lungs to a usable state.With this method, they have successfully revived and transplanted 600 lungs in the past decade, said Dr. Marcelo Cypel, a lung transplant surgeon at the University of Toronto. But there are limitations: Lungs can be maintained this way only for hours, not days. And few lungs can be rescued.\u201cIf you have more time, you have more time to repair the injuries,\u201d Dr. Cypel said. \u201cYou can\u2019t reverse a pneumonia in just four or six hours. But if you keep the lung for a few days, you can.\u201dSo Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic and her group decided that instead of making new lungs, they might improve on this method. It was becoming clear that, to recover, lungs needed not just a ventilator but also body \u2014 to remove metabolic wastes, and to deliver the energy needed keep the organ alive and restore it to health.The solution? A pig to support the lung as it recovered. In animal experiments, the researchers managed to keep damaged pig lungs \u201cbreathing\u201d for four days, long enough for even severely damaged lungs to repair themselves.The scientists were finally ready to try their method with human lungs. The six organs they received, the ones turned down by surgeons everywhere, were gravely damaged. One had already failed to improve after six hours of treatment with the original method, a ventilator and nutrient fluid.But 24 hours after the procedures began, all six lungs looked bright pink and healthy. Laboratory tests showed the lung cells had recovered.\u201cThe pig was able to keep the lung alive and allow it to repair itself,\u201d Dr. Bacchetta said.Blood from pigs offers both advantages and disadvantages over that of human patients, researchers said. Patients on lung transplant lists are very sick, for example, and may not be able to tolerate having a large tube connected to their necks.But pigs also carry viruses, and their blood cells may cause immune reactions in patients.The system does sound like science fiction, Dr. Kon acknowledged. Imagine a transplant patient hooked up to a lung in a box, \u201cbreathing\u201d with a respirator.\u201cBut this paper really demonstrates that it probably does and can work,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/health/coronavirus-trump-deaths.html", "title": "Trump\u2019s Health Officials Warn More Will Die as Covid Cases Rise", "summary": "They struck a sober note on Sunday\u2019s news programs, strongly urging the vast majority of people in hard-hit cities and states to wear masks and avoid large gatherings.", "authors": "By Pam Belluck", "text": "Two of the Trump administration\u2019s top health officials acknowledged Sunday that the country is facing a very serious situation with the onslaught of rising coronavirus cases in several states, striking a far more sober tone than President Trump at this stage of the pandemic in the United States.Adm.

Roughly 80 percent of the state\u2019s population lives in the affected counties, Mr. Newsom said.California was averaging more than 8,000 new cases a day as of Sunday, more than double what it was a month ago. The state has seen 331,626 cases, the second highest tally in the nation, and more than 7,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database.\u201cWe\u2019re going back into modification mode of our original stay at home order,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cThis continues to be a deadly disease.\u201dMr. Newsom emphasized that state officials have repeatedly said the state\u2019s reopening process would be more akin to a \u201cdimmer switch\u201d than an on or off switch. In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said Monday that she would ban indoor gatherings of more than 10 people for things like birthday parties, potlucks, book clubs and dinner gatherings. She said the new ban would not apply to the operations of businesses or churches \u201cat this time.\u201dMr. Newsom made the announcement after California\u2019s two largest public school districts said Monday that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers.The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enroll some 825,000 students, are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August.More than a third of California\u2019s coronavirus cases are in Los Angeles County and San Diego County has had 18 community outbreaks over the past week, more than double the state\u2019s acceptable threshold.The joint announcement came as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to press the Trump administration\u2019s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students\u2019 social and emotional development, but so that parents can return to work fully.The recommendations from the president and Ms. DeVos have been disputed by many public health officials and teachers. On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association issued a statement saying that reopening recommendations should be \u201cbased on evidence, not politics.\u201dThe groups added that \u201cwe should leave it to health experts to tell us when the time is best to open up school buildings, and listen to educators and administrators to shape how we do it.\u201dIn the Los Angeles and San Diego districts\u2019 joint statement, they noted that while much has been learned about the virus, many recommendations and findings are vague and contradictory.But \u201cone fact is clear,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThose countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available.

But there is enormous pressure to bring students back \u2014 from parents, from pediatricians and child development specialists, and from President Trump.\u201cI\u2019m just going to say it: It feels like we\u2019re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,\u201d said Robin Cogan, a nurse at the Yorkship School in Camden, N.J., who serves on the state\u2019s committee on reopening schools.Data from around the world clearly shows that children are far less likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus than adults. But there are big unanswered questions, including how often children become infected and what role they play in transmitting the virus. Some research suggests younger children are less likely to infect other people than teenagers are, which would make opening elementary schools less risky than high schools, but the evidence is not conclusive.The experience abroad has shown that measures such as physical distancing and wearing masks in schools can make a difference. Another important variable is how widespread the virus is in the community over all, because that will affect how many people potentially bring it into a school.For most districts, the solution won\u2019t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation\u2019s largest, New York City, are devising hybrids that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online.\u201cYou have to do a lot more than just waving your hands and say make it so,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a professor of the practice at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cFirst you have to control the community spread and then you have to open schools thoughtfully.\u201dThe transmission puzzleThough children are at much lower risk of getting seriously ill from the coronavirus than adults, the risk is not zero. A small number of children have died and others needed intensive care because they suffered respiratory failure or an inflammatory syndrome that caused heart or circulatory problems.The larger concern with reopening schools is the potential for children to become infected, many with no symptoms, and then spread the virus to others, including family members, teachers and other school employees. Most evidence to date suggests that even if children under 12 are infected at the same rates as the adults around them, they are less likely to spread it. The American Academy of Pediatrics has cited some of this data to recommend that schools reopen with proper safety precautions.But the bulk of the evidence was collected in countries that were already in lockdown or had begun to implement other preventive measures. And few countries have systematically tested children for the virus or for antibodies that would indicate whether they had been exposed to the virus.Infectious disease specialists have been modeling schools\u2019 impact on community spread beginning as far back as February. ImageNursing students Soledad Lupian, left, and Edwin Gituma showed first graders at Ethel Phillips Elementary School in Sacramento how to properly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in March, before schools closed.Credit...Max Whittaker for The New York TimesIn March, most modelers agreed that closing schools would slow the progression of infections. But wider measures, like social distancing, proved to have a far greater containing effect, overshadowing the results of school closings, according to recent analyses.The risk of reopening \u201cwill depend on how well schools contain transmission, with masks, for instance, or limiting occupancy,\u201d said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and statistics at the University of Texas, Austin, who has been consulting with the city and school districts. \u201cThe background community transmission rate in August will also be a factor.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/health/coronavirus-race-pregnancy.html", "title": "Study of Coronavirus in Pregnant Women Finds Striking Racial Differences", "summary": "About 10 percent of Black and Latino participants in a Philadelphia study of pregnant women had been exposed to the coronavirus, compared with 2 percent of white participants.", "authors": "By Katherine J.

Fearing she would get infected on the train that took her to the lab every day, she moved from her apartment in East Harlem to an Airbnb five minutes from the company\u2019s headquarters in Tarrytown, in Westchester County.Then her mother, a nurse\u2019s assistant who cared for newborn babies at a Long Island hospital, was reassigned to a Covid-19 ward where she tended to older people struggling to breathe. No drug could help these patients \u2014\u00a0or her, if she were to get sick, too.\u201cI had somebody on the line that I really cared about,\u201d Ms. Giordano said recently. \u201cAnd I wanted to see her make it through this.\u201dMs. Giordano, the youngest member of the company\u2019s five-person rapid response team for infectious diseases, helped develop what many consider one of the most promising new treatments for Covid-19, which has now infected more than 12 million people around the world, and killed more than 549,000.She worked in the lab until 10 many nights and through weekends, screening thousands of antibodies \u2014 the weapons of the immune system that seek out and destroy viruses \u2014 in search of the most powerful ones. The result was a cocktail of two antibodies that might not only treat the virus, but prevent it by giving the body the same natural defenses that people infected with it produce on their own.The Trump administration this week gave a major boost to Regeneron\u2019s treatment, awarding the company $450 million to manufacture and supply as many as 300,000 doses as treatments or 1.3 million doses to prevent infection. That\u2019s in addition to $160 million in federal money the company had already received to run clinical trials and ramp up manufacturing.

The companies will also provide free expertise to biotech companies with promising drugs as they navigate the clinical and regulatory hurdles needed to bring an antimicrobial compound from laboratory to market.\u201cAntibiotics are the mortar that holds the entire health care system together,\u201d said David A. Ricks, the chief executive of Eli Lilly, who helped spearhead the effort. \u201cWe make drugs for diabetes, cancer and immunological conditions, but you couldn\u2019t treat any of them without effective antibiotics.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Ricks said he was well aware of the irony that Eli Lilly and many of the other companies contributing to the fund were once the giants of antibiotic development but have long since abandoned the field because of their inability to earn money on the drugs. \u201cWe know firsthand how broken the system is,\u201d he said.The crisis stems from the peculiar economics and biochemical quirks of drugs that kill bacteria and fungi. The more often antimicrobial drugs are used, the more likely they are to lose their efficacy as pathogens survive and mutate. Efforts to promote antibiotic stewardship mean that new drugs are used as a last resort, limiting the ability of companies to earn back the billions of dollars it can take to create a new product.\u201cIt\u2019s been a really tough time for companies doing antibiotic discovery despite the tremendous unmet need,\u201d said Zachary Zimmerman, the chief executive of Forge Therapeutics, a San Diego company that has several new drugs in the pipeline. He said the fund would provide critical help for companies that have already spent millions identifying an innovative compound but lack the money to carry out the costly clinical trials needed to gain regulatory approval. \u201cA fund like this can really help us get through that valley of death,\u201d Mr. Zimmerman said.The collapse of the antibiotic market has dramatically reduced the number of promising drugs. Between 1980 and 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved 61 new antibiotics for systemic use; over the past decade that number has shrunk to 15, and a third of the companies behind those medicines have since gone belly up."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/health/coronavirus-masks-ppe-doc.html", "title": "Grave Shortages of Protective Gear Flare Again as Covid Cases Surge", "summary": "Five months into the pandemic, the U.S. still hasn\u2019t solved the problem.

The country\u2019s largest organization of registered nurses found in a survey of its members in late June that 85 percent had been forced to reuse disposable N95 masks while treating coronavirus patients. In Florida, some hospitals are handing out only loosefitting surgical masks to workers treating newly admitted patients who may be asymptomatic carriers.The inability to find personal protective equipment, known as P.P.E., is starting to impede other critical areas of medicine too. Neurologists, cardiologists and cancer specialists around the country have been unable to reopen their offices in recent weeks, leaving many patients without care, according to the American Medical Association and other doctor groups.\u201cWe have kids living with grapefruit-sized abscesses for over three months who can\u2019t eat or drink and there\u2019s nothing we can do for them because we can\u2019t get P.P.E.,\u201d said Kay Kennel, the chief officer of Lubbock Kids Dental, a clinic serving low-income families in Texas that has a list of 50 children awaiting emergency surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s been just horrible, and given the growing number of infections here, I\u2019m afraid things are going to get worse.\u201dIn a coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence downplayed the shortages, but said the government was preparing to issue new guidance on the preservation and reuse of protective gear. \u201cP.P.E., we hear, remains very strong,\u201d he said.Many of the problems of early spring, when hospital workers in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, California and other states first walloped by the virus scrambled to obtain rudimentary protective gear, have only grown. The United States remains dependent on overseas manufacturers and fly-by-night middlemen who have jacked up prices sevenfold amid soaring global demand, according to supply chain specialists and public health experts, who warn that the problem will intensify as the pandemic spreads.

Even four days after close contact with a person who is shedding the novel coronavirus, 40 percent of tests that come back negative will likely be false.Thus, even if a test for Covid-19 is negative, anyone knowingly exposed to the virus is advised to self-isolate for 14 days. And those who develop symptoms consistent with Covid-19 should isolate throughout the entire illness plus three more days after they recover.Late in June there were long lines for testing, noted Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor of JAMA. He said that if people have been well and not knowingly exposed to the virus there\u2019s no reason for them to be tested. Overuse of testing clogs up the testing lines, he said, and could make it more difficult for people truly infected to get a test that would help protect others (unless, of course, the test is part of contact tracing or a community-mandated pool to spot a potential outbreak).In an interview with Dr. Bauchner, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people are sometimes disappointed when the test is negative.

Twins Can Provide an Answer", "summary": "Almost everyone responds to the right exercise program, but the right program is not genetics-dependent.", "authors": "By Gretchen Reynolds", "text": "If you start exercising and do not seem to be gaining as much endurance or strength as you had hoped, you might want to switch up your routine, according to a fascinating new study of exercise responders and non-responders.The study, which involved twins, shows that almost everyone responds to the right exercise program, but the right exercise program can differ from person to person. The findings also indicate that genetics may play less of a role than we imagine in how our bodies respond to workouts.The idea that people\u2019s physiques react differently to the same exercise might seem implausible, at first. Most of us probably expect that when we begin a new walking, jogging or weight-training regimen with friends or other training partners, we all will progress about equally and gain comparable physical benefits.But recent research indicates that our physical responses can be surprisingly idiosyncratic. After a few months of running, one person may gain considerable aerobic fitness, while another\u2019s endurance hardly budges. Ditto for weight training, where some people build far more strength than others, even if they lift the same amount of weight.Few studies, though, have delved into whether people\u2019s responses are monolithic \u2014 meaning someone who barely responds to one kind of exercise will gain little from other types of exertion \u2014 or supple, so that swapping routines should raise response.The impact of genetics likewise has been uncertain. In some past studies, exercise response has seemed to run in families, with parents and siblings sharing similar physiological exercise gains or droughts, a potentially disheartening finding for anyone whose familial history suggests low response. But those studies tended to be epidemiological, not experimental; they asked about people\u2019s exercise histories but did not ask people actually to exercise while tracking whether and how their familial genetics affected responses.So, for the new study, which was published in June in the Journal of Physiology, researchers at the University of Western Australia in Perth and the University of Melbourne decided to study both the variability and genetics of exercise response by asking pairs of twins to work out together.Twins can be uniquely useful to science (full disclosure: I am a twin), since identical pairs share 100 percent of their DNA, while fraternal twins share about 50 percent, like any siblings. If twins try something new and the identical pairs react almost identically and the fraternal ones do not, then the intervention has a strong genetic component. If, on the other hand, everyone\u2019s reactions are mixed, with some twins, both identical and not, responding more or less than others, then genetics is less foundational to these responses than lifestyle factors such as people\u2019s diets, education, weight, mental states and so on.Now, the researchers recruited 42 sets of young, healthy and sedentary twins in Perth, 30 of the pairs identical and 12 fraternal. (Several of the pairs believed they were fraternal, but genetic testing at the start of the study revealed they, in fact, were identical, to everyone\u2019s surprise.) Some participants were male, some female. The scientists measured the twins\u2019 current endurance and leg strength and then directed them to start exercising.Each of the sets of twins worked out together for two three-month periods. During one, they ran or cycled for an hour three times a week. During the other, they lifted weights three times a week, also for about an hour. At the end of each three-month session, the twins returned to the lab and the researchers rechecked their aerobic capacities and muscle power. Then they compared how various twins\u2019 legs and lungs had changed during these exertions.The results were telling. Most of the 84 participants upped their endurance during their three months of jogging and biking, but not all. So, too, leg strength rose in most of the twins after three months at the gym, but stayed relatively puny in a few.Almost no one, however, responded poorly to both the endurance and strength training. In other words, those volunteers who gained little fitness bang from running substantially pumped up their strength after lifting, and vice versa.\u201cThere were very few recalcitrant non-responders,\u201d says Daniel Green, a professor of exercise science at the University of Western Australia, who conducted the new study with his doctoral students Channa Marsh and Hannah Thomas and others. \u201cAlmost all of those who failed to respond to one form of training were capable of gaining benefit by switching to the other.\u201dInterestingly, the benefits gained could be broad. In some cases, non-responders to aerobic exercise added endurance when they turned to weight training, even though lifting mostly targets muscles.At the same time, there was little evidence that genes shaped people\u2019s outcomes, since the twins\u2019 responses varied wildly, even among identical pairs.The upshot of this data is that we should not be discouraged if prolonged running or lifting does not produce the results we hope for. We might, in that case, want to noodle about with different approaches. \u201cThere is an optimal exercise strategy for everyone,\u201d Dr. Green says, \u201cbut it differs between people,\u201d and will not be determined or limited only by your DNA.Of course, this study was short-term and limited to two types of exercise. It did not vary the workouts\u2019 intensity or duration. And it cannot tell us what factors most influence our responses, if genetics do not. Is it diet, mind-set, age or something else?Dr. Green and his associates hope to look into some of those issues in future twin studies. But for now, he says, we know that \u201cnot everyone reacts to exercise in the same way. But there is something out there that will benefit almost everyone.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/well/live/coronavirus-lingering-symptoms.html", "title": "Whipped by the \u2018Long Tail\u2019 of the Coronavirus", "summary": "When the E.R. nurse asked if I\u2019d been short of breath that day, I replied that I\u2019d been short of breath for 65 days.", "authors": "By Jodie Noel Vinson", "text": "On day 45 of our illness, my husband, Marc, and I woke up and looked at each other.

But experts say the science hasn\u2019t changed: Your risk of catching the virus is much lower outdoors than indoors. If you want to spend time with friends, taking the party outside will reduce your risk of contracting Covid-19.\u201cOutside is definitely safer,\u201d said Erin Bromage, a comparative immunologist and biology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. \u201cBut it\u2019s the type of interactions you have when you\u2019re outside that are important.\u201dA Japanese study of 100 cases found that the odds of catching the coronavirus are nearly 20 times higher indoors than outdoors. Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen indoors when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.If you socialize outdoors, it\u2019s important to keep the guest list small. Socializing with just one additional household is safer than mixing multiple households. Make sure that the rate of Covid-19 in your community is low and falling. It\u2019s safest to socialize when the test positivity rate is at 5 percent or lower \u2014 a level that reduces your chances of inviting an infected person to the party.Recent clusters of cases have been linked to home gatherings that appear to have broken those rules. After an estimated 100 people gathered for a party in Rockland County, N.Y., public health officials tracked nine cases to the event. In Washington D.C., a June 18 backyard fund-raiser with about two dozen guests made headlines when the host and a few guests were reportedly diagnosed with Covid-19. In Texas, a May 30 surprise party infected 18 family members.But adding to the confusion about outdoor gatherings is the fact that the continuing protests over police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis have not been associated with spikes in cases.

No drug could help these patients \u2014\u00a0or her, if she were to get sick, too.\u201cI had somebody on the line that I really cared about,\u201d Ms. Giordano said recently. \u201cAnd I wanted to see her make it through this.\u201dMs. Giordano, the youngest member of the company\u2019s five-person rapid response team for infectious diseases, helped develop what many consider one of the most promising new treatments for Covid-19, which has now infected more than 12 million people around the world, and killed more than 549,000.She worked in the lab until 10 many nights and through weekends, screening thousands of antibodies \u2014 the weapons of the immune system that seek out and destroy viruses \u2014 in search of the most powerful ones. The result was a cocktail of two antibodies that might not only treat the virus, but prevent it by giving the body the same natural defenses that people infected with it produce on their own.The Trump administration this week gave a major boost to Regeneron\u2019s treatment, awarding the company $450 million to manufacture and supply as many as 300,000 doses as treatments or 1.3 million doses to prevent infection. That\u2019s in addition to $160 million in federal money the company had already received to run clinical trials and ramp up manufacturing. After the treatment passed an initial safety study, Regeneron\u2019s broader trials to evaluate the product\u2019s efficacy got underway.ImageThe Westchester campus of the pharmaceutical company Regeneron.Credit...Melissa Bunni Elian for The New York TimesDr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, recently singled out the treatment as the most likely to pan out soon. \u201cIf I had to pick one, I think the monoclonal antibody cocktails have a lot going for them,\u201d Dr. Collins said at a Senate hearing last week. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons to think this is the kind of virus it should work for.\u201dIf the trials are successful, company executives have said the treatment could be available by the end of the summer. The hope is that it could serve as a stopgap until a vaccine arrives by providing temporary protection to people at high risk of getting infected.Regeneron is making a significant gamble, ramping up manufacturing of the antibody cocktail before clinical trials have even proved that it works. The most lucrative drugs it makes for other diseases have been relocated to a factory in Ireland.Regeneron is one of several companies pursuing monoclonal antibody treatments. The drug giant Eli Lilly has also begun clinical trials, and others working on antibody treatments include partnerships of Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies and also Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline.It\u2019s unclear which of these projects \u2014 if any \u2014 will succeed. Drug development is notoriously unpredictable: Just last week, Regeneron announced that an older monoclonal antibody drug, the rheumatoid arthritis treatment Kevzara, had failed to help patients critically ill with Covid-19."}, null, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html", "title": "Redskins to Drop Name, Yielding to Pressure From Sponsors and Activists", "summary": "The N.F.L. team in Washington announced the move on Monday and will continue its search for a new name and logo.", "authors": "By Ken Belson and Kevin Draper", "text": "First the N.F.L. team in Washington removed the name of its founder, George Preston Marshall \u2014 the man who named his team the \u201cRedskins\u201d \u2014 from inside its stadium and at its training facility. Then the city of Washington took down a tribute to him that was in front of the team\u2019s old home, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.On Monday, under pressure from corporate sponsors, the team announced it would drop its logo and \u201cRedskins\u201d from its name, an all but forced turnaround by team owner Daniel Snyder, who for decades said he would never change the name that had long been considered a racial slur.\u201cToday, we are announcing we will be retiring the Redskins name and logo upon completion of this review,\u2019\u2019 the team said in a statement.The decision came just 10 days after the team said it would review the 87-year-old team name under significant pressure from major corporate partners including FedEx, which had threatened to end its naming rights sponsorship of the team\u2019s stadium. Snyder\u2019s shift from total resistance to grudging acceptance in just a few weeks has been remarkably swift in a league that often moves forward deliberately, if at all. But after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May, the country as a whole has come under pressure to change policies to emphasize antiracism.The team, one of the oldest in the N.F.L., did not announce a new name on Monday as it continues to evaluate possibilities. Snyder said the new name, when chosen, would \u201ctake into account not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League and the local community it is proud to represent on and off the field.\u201dThe move by one of the country\u2019s most valuable professional sports franchises to change its name comes after hundreds of universities and schools have in recent years abandoned team names and mascots with Native American imagery.\u201cThis day of the retirement of the r-word slur and stereotypical logo belongs to all those Native families,\u201d said Suzan Shown Harjo, a Native American activist. She said that the change was a victory for all those who \u201cbore the brunt of and carry the scars from the epithets, beatings, death threats and other emotional and physical brutalities resulting from all the \u2018Native\u2019 sports names and images that cause harm and injury to actual Native people.\u201dThe name change is likely to put pressure on the remaining professional teams with Native American mascots and logos to re-evaluate their names and monikers. The Kansas City Chiefs of the N.F.L., the Chicago Blackhawks of the N.H.L. and the Atlanta Braves and the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball have long resisted changing their names and logos, though the Indians dropped the mascot Chief Wahoo last year and recently said they would review the team name.In Washington, official branding is the most immediate task, but it is unclear how the team will address fans who continue to wear headdresses, war paint, and other stereotypical imagery to games or if it will replace its fight song, \u201cHail to the Redskins,\u201d which contains references to \u201cbraves on the warpath\u201d and is played after touchdowns at home games. The team may get to delay making those decisions if fans are not allowed to attend games this season because of the coronavirus.Washington has been in the spotlight, in part because of its long and checkered racial history. Marshall, the team\u2019s founder, named it the Redskins, which he considered a nod to bravery. Marshall was the last owner in the N.F.L. to sign a Black player, and only under pressure from the federal government.At the end of June, some of the team\u2019s biggest sponsors, including FedEx, Nike and Pepsi, received letters from investors who called on the companies to cut their ties with the team. On July 2, FedEx, which pays about $8 million a year to have its name on the team\u2019s stadium in Landover, Md., told the Redskins in a letter that if the team did not change its name it would ask that its name be taken off the stadium at the end of the coming season.The next day, July 3, the team said a change was likely to be forthcoming, when it began a \u201cthorough review of the team\u2019s name,\u201d after weeks of discussions with the N.F.L. Nike stopped selling the team\u2019s gear, and Walmart, Target and Amazon \u2014 some of the country\u2019s largest retailers \u2014 said they would stop selling Washington\u2019s merchandise on their websites.The boycott came after decades of pressure on the team to change the name, which many people (and some dictionaries) consider to be offensive. In 1992, Native American activists began a campaign to compel the United States Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the team\u2019s \u201credskin\u201d trademark, a legal battle that the Supreme Court ended in 2017, finding that even potentially disparaging trademarks are protected by the First Amendment.In 2014, 50 U.S. senators sent a letter to the N.F.L. urging the league to step in. And across the country, waves of universities and schools abandoned mascots and sports team names with Native American symbols.But more than 2,200 high schools still use Native American imagery in their names or mascots, according to a database of mascot names.All the while, Snyder, who purchased the Washington team in 1999, remained steadfast. \u201cWe will never change the name of the team,\u201d he said in 2013, a stance he maintained even in the face of pushback from activists, politicians and some fans.What finally changed was, seemingly, wider American society around the team. After the death of Floyd, there has been a widespread reconsideration of statues, flags, symbols and mascots considered to be racist or celebrating racist history.Now that the team has let go of its current name, it will have to find a replacement, a process that requires navigating trademarks and the league\u2019s many licensing deals with partners and which can often take years. Teams use their name, logos and colors to forge a new identity, a process that can include speaking with sponsors, fans and other constituents.Ed O\u2019Hara, who has designed team names and logos for more than 30 years, said that dropping the existing name first will buy time for Snyder to find a replacement. The team\u2019s existing colors are unique and powerful, he said. A good name, though, should have an easy connection to a mascot, be easy to say and be connected to the market where the team plays.\u201cThe name is always the hardest part,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get one chance to make this right for the next 80 years.\u201dGillian R.

As Maria Taylor, a fast-rising star who has hosted several shows, spoke about her treatment at ESPN, she was interrupted by a white male play-by-play announcer who apparently did not realize that his microphone was not muted.The announcer, Dave LaMont, could be heard complaining to someone that the call was just a griping session for Black employees.\u201cIt was such a slap in the face,\u201d Taylor said in an interview. \u201cWhen I was in it, that was horrible. But now, looking back, it was an awakening moment. This is part of our culture. There are people that feel this way.\u201dWhen asked about the call, ESPN said it had \u201caddressed it appropriately,\u201d without elaborating.Reached before publication of this article, LaMont declined to comment. After it was published, LaMont said in an email that he did not \u201cdemean the nature of the phone call\u201d and apologized for the interruption. He said his exact words on the call were: \u201cThis call is not about college football. People are venting.\u201dJimmy Pitaro, ESPN\u2019s president, acknowledged that the company was not where it wanted to be on diversity, especially behind the camera, and said a frequent topic of conversation was how to make ESPN more \u201crelevant\u201d to people of color. \u201cWe cannot have rooms full of just white decision makers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur execs and employees need to reflect the audience that we are trying to reach.\u201dIn interviews, more than two dozen current and former ESPN employees, including many who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared punishment, described a company that projected a diverse outward face, but did not have enough Black executives, especially ones with real decision-making power. They said the company did not provide meaningful career paths for Black employees behind the camera and made decisions based on assumptions that its average viewer is an older white man, in spite of its audience trends.ESPN acknowledges hiring shortfalls, but points to corporate America.As ESPN grew into a sports media powerhouse in the 1990s, its executives remained almost exclusively white and male.John Skipper, who was ESPN\u2019s president until 2017, recalled a meeting of the company\u2019s senior staff around 2000, when he was in charge of ESPN the Magazine. Kerry Chandler, a Black woman who was then a senior human resources executive, led a vigorous discussion about diversity. Besides Chandler, Skipper could not remember another nonwhite person in the meeting.\u201cTwenty-two out of 25 were white men, including me, of course,\u201d he said, making it clear he was speaking about his time at ESPN.Twenty years later, the company\u2019s executive ranks look different, though the biggest difference is the elevation of white women. ESPN declined to provide figures on the racial composition of its executives, but said 25 percent of the people who report directly to Pitaro are Black, all men.Each of those Black executives had at least a 20-year career before joining ESPN, while a number of senior white executives have only ever worked at ESPN, suggesting to many Black employees a limited career path for them at ESPN. One former midlevel employee who is Black and spoke on condition of anonymity to not jeopardize relationships in the industry said she searched for a new position within ESPN and did not want to leave the company, but no executive made an effort to retain her.After being contacted for this article, ESPN made four Black senior executives available for interviews: Rob King, Kevin Merida, Dave Roberts and Paul Richardson. A representative from ESPN\u2019s communications department was present for each interview, as well as every other on-the-record interview conducted with a current employee.King, Merida and Roberts each oversee various content arms, while Richardson is the head of human resources. In those interviews, all four executives said that ESPN\u2019s executive ranks were not diverse enough, but mostly attributed that to a larger problem in corporate America. They all said every one of the company\u2019s senior leaders believes in diversity and inclusion.\u201cLike most media companies, including the one you write for, there was a time when you didn\u2019t have African-Americans in editorial positions that could grow from entry level to the highest potential levels of the company,\u201d said Roberts, who joined ESPN in the mid-2000s as a coordinating producer. He believes ESPN\u2019s Black senior vice presidents \u201ccan help continue to evolve and change and grow the process and progress of diversity.\u201dBlack on-air employees were much more direct about what they believe are ESPN\u2019s failings. \u201cSo many of the Black people we have at ESPN have been worthy of promotions and other opportunities long before this happened,\u201d said Michael Eaves, a \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor, referring to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, an event that is powering a movement against police brutality and racial injustice.Even powerful employees who largely had good things to say about the company\u2019s record on diversity believed there were areas where ESPN had fallen painfully behind. \u201cThere are certain things that should have been done years ago,\u201d said Stephen A. Smith, perhaps the network\u2019s biggest star. He said that for years he has pointed out to ESPN leaders that its executives overseeing N.F.L., N.B.A. and M.L.B. programming are all white.\u201cThere are a plethora of people that have come through ESPN that I thought could do some very positive things for ESPN about that bottom line,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey happened to be Black, and I don\u2019t believe they have been put in those positions.\u201dOther current and former Black ESPN employees described active discrimination.Cari Champion worked at ESPN for eight years, including several hosting \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d before leaving this year. She said that while the company gave her an unrivaled platform, she left in part because of \u201cconstant dismissals and borderline harassment\u201d from Jill Fredrickson, a senior executive she reported to.Champion described hearing \u201cmicroaggressions and dog whistle words,\u201d saying such \u201csubtleties are racism in corporate America.\u201dIn an interview, Fredrickson declined to directly address her relationship with Champion. She said she thought Champion had been heard, and that she \u201calways wanted to have an open dialogue to her.\u201d She continued, \u201cI thought that she left amicably.\u201dImageCredit...Colin Laurel\u2018There are white people that don\u2019t have her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u2019ESPN presents a fairly diverse face to the outside world across its slate of programming, and its news editors and reporters are more diverse than most of its competitors and sports departments in newsrooms nationwide. A 2018 report found that ESPN employed a significant percentage of the country\u2019s Black, Latino and female assistant sports editors and columnists.But current and former employees say that things are very different behind the camera.Richardson said that the retention rate for Black employees is high, but not as high as it is for white employees. He attributed the difference to some Black employees not wanting to live in Bristol, Conn., where ESPN has its headquarters, as well as aggressive poaching by competitors.There was no sign, he said, that Black employees found ESPN unwelcome. But that conflicts with how many employees described their own experiences.In an N.B.A. coverage meeting last month, it was pointed out that of more than 40 people on the call, including a top executive, there was only one Black employee, a Somali-American coordinating producer named Amina Hussein. According to two people on the call, Hussein told leaders that she had mentored many younger Black employees, but lately had told some that their career advancement prospects would improve if they left the company. She declined to discuss the call for this article.Hussein has overseen \u201cSunday NFL Countdown\u201d and \u201cNBA Countdown,\u201d two high-profile programs on ESPN. Still, she was not offered a promotion in over a decade. She became a coordinating producer in 2008, the same year as Lee Fitting, a white man. Fitting has since risen several levels above Hussein to oversee all N.F.L. and college football coverage.\u201cIf Amina was a white person she would be V.P.,\u201d said Jemele Hill, who hosted a number of shows on ESPN before leaving in 2018. \u201cThere are white people that don\u2019t have her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201dHussein was promoted in July to senior coordinating producer.Employees see the problems as enduring, not new.Black ESPN employees repeatedly brought up the experience of Hill and Michael Smith, who were made \u201cSportsCenter\u201d hosts in 2017 and tried to bring an unapologetically Black spirit into the meat-and-potatoes highlight factory that is \u201cSportsCenter.\u201dThe show was quickly tagged as \u201ctoo political\u201d and met fierce resistance inside ESPN.\u201cPretty quickly, that was a show that people internally criticized,\u201d Skipper said. \u201cWe had plenty of times where we had shows that didn\u2019t work with nondiverse talent on them, and people never said, \u2018You went too far with those two white guys.\u2019\u201dNorby Williamson, a white senior executive, was put in charge of the show, which Hill said was a signal that its days were numbered. After Hill and Smith left it, and eventually ESPN, Williamson began remaking \u201cSportsCenter\u201d in a much more traditional direction, an effort The Washington Post reported on in 2018.ImageJemele Hill.Credit...Colin LaurelWhile executives inside ESPN saw the profile as a success, Black employees noticed a photograph of a staff meeting in the article that contained a sea of white faces. They read his quotation \u2014 \u201cNever forget: I\u2019m the person you have to serve here\u201d \u2014 and wondered what that said about ESPN\u2019s priorities.ESPN said the photograph did not represent the diversity of the call, in which 180 people had been invited, many of them participating remotely. \u201cI\u2019m proud of actually how exceptionally diverse it is,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI am sorry people interpreted that and took that away.\u201dThe network has changed its approach to covering unrest among American athletes.Over the last several months, as games have been largely suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic and as athletes have spoken about racism, ESPN\u2019s television programs have been dominated by discussions of police brutality, racism and white privilege. Last week, the Walt Disney Company, which owns ESPN, signed a deal to produce shows with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback, that included Hill as a producer.Given how purposefully ESPN has sought to shed the label that it is \u201ctoo liberal\u201d and avoid the wrath of the president\u2019s Twitter account after the bruising battles of 2017, the shift in tone has been stark.ESPN\u2019s position is that it has always sought to avoid \u201cpure politics\u201d while aggressively covering the intersection of sports, politics and culture. Executives pointed to The Undefeated, an ESPN site that covers race that has grown in importance over the years and is a part of the Kaepernick deal. The recent programming, executives said, simply reflects the upheaval in the sports world.ImageMaria Taylor.Credit...Colin LaurelSome employees aren\u2019t buying that explanation. \u201cIt is interesting because I was on \u2018Get Up\u2019 when there were certain stories about Colin Kaepernick, would he have a workout or a tryout, and to be honest it would be a voice-over and no discussion,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cVirtually every other question could be discussed.\u201dA number of other employees described being told in various ways to tone down or skip their on-air coverage of sports and race. \u201cIt was never explicit, it was just sort of us reading the room,\u201d Elle Duncan, a \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor, said.The company has pledged changes.Pitaro, the ESPN president, has laid out a series of changes. He said that ESPN would have more diverse meetings and ensure all voices were included, that interview and hiring practices would be improved, that leadership development would be strengthened and new employee programs reviewed, among other changes.\u201cWe are going to speak through our actions here, and we are going to improve,\u201d Pitaro said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, it is on me, I failed, because it does all start with me.\u201dCurrent and former employees expressed mixed opinions about the prospect for change. Many believe their concerns rank lower in his priorities compared with maintaining relationships with sports leagues and Disney, the corporate parent. Much of the day-to-day running of ESPN, they said, falls to senior executives and others below him who do not share his priorities.\u201cI am confident that based on the conversations that I am having daily, that leaders across ESPN understand the importance of diversity and the urgency here,\u201d Pitaro said.Duncan has been a part of a group of Black employees who have been meeting with a top executive since the beginning of the year about increasing the company\u2019s diversity beyond on-air talent. She expects there will be pushback, but the executives she has spoken with are genuine in their desire to change the company.\u201cI truly, truly, believe ESPN wants to be on the right side of history,\u201d she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/soccer/man-city-ffp.html", "title": "Manchester City Won.

But the demise of cost-control rules risks destabilizing teams, and a sport already shaken by the coronavirus pandemic.", "authors": "By Rory Smith", "text": "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 Manchester City has its answer: the answer it wanted, the answer it was adamant, right from the start, was the only one possible.There will be no two-year ban from the Champions League. There is no reason to worry that Pep Guardiola might seek new pastures earlier than expected, or that Kevin De Bruyne or Raheem Sterling or any other member of City\u2019s galaxy of stars will feel the urge to leave. All of those achievements of the last decade stand, unblemished.To Manchester City and its fans, that is what matters. The Court of Arbitration for Sport has cleared its name on appeal, striking down the charge from UEFA, the body theoretically in charge of European soccer, that City misrepresented some of its financing to circumvent cost-control rules.True, there might still be quibbles, queries. Like whether a determination that the most serious accusations against City fell outside UEFA\u2019s statute of limitations counts as total exoneration. Or if you can claim to be exonerated as you pay a fine of more than $11 million. Or how what the club had said was a \u201ccomprehensive body of irrefutable proof\u201d of its innocence came down to UEFA\u2019s not being able to make its case.City had claimed that a cache of emails, released as part of the Football Leaks documents and explosive enough to attract UEFA\u2019s attention, had been not just hacked but \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d It is not yet clear quite what that context might be. Perhaps the full ruling from CAS, scheduled to be published later this week, will clear it all up. Perhaps not.No matter: Nobody goes past the first page of Google. For City, six years of skirmishing with UEFA over its financial fair play regulations is at an end. It has its victory. Any dissent to that orthodoxy will be dismissed as sour grapes, bile produced by bitterness.But the ramifications of this case were always likely to extend way beyond the club at its center. If there will be no tangible consequences for City \u2014 carte blanche to back Guardiola, to build a dynasty, to extend its empire of clubs \u2014 the same cannot be said for European soccer more broadly.ImageManchester City\u2019s benefactor, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, in 2010. The club has been transformed under his aegis.Credit...Andrew Yates/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesAt first glance, it seems a little overblown to suggest this as a Bosman moment for the 21st century: the point at which the Financial Fair Play experiment takes its last breath, where UEFA acquiesces to fate and sits idly by as clubs spend what they like.The organization, after all, has emphasized its continuing commitment to its regulations. City has not proved F.F.P. is illegal under European Union law (and was not, in the end, trying to). UEFA has simply not brought a strong enough, or quick enough, case to police its rules in this instance.The problem is that it is not just this instance. This is the third time UEFA has tried to punish one of the continent\u2019s elite \u2014 for all its attempts to characterize itself as some sort of insurgent underdog, that is precisely the group to which Manchester City belongs \u2014 and it is the third time it has failed to bring any of them to heel. It has been undone, again, by procedural technicalities.There has been no spectacular, conclusive breach in F.F.P.; just a series of cracks appearing, fatally undermining the foundation. For the richest and most powerful clubs, the rules are starting to look an awful lot like guidelines, and the impression is that UEFA cannot universally enforce them, anyway. There is, now, precious little incentive for anyone to adhere to them.That such a blow should be delivered now is significant. UEFA has already agreed to suspend, temporarily, some of its cost-control measures, to allow clubs to ride out the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Even before the virus hit, though, UEFA was considering how its financial rules might be altered, updated, possibly simplified, to make them easier to understand and \u2014 possibly \u2014 more appealing to follow. City\u2019s acquittal lends weight to the argument that the current approach is not up to the task, but it also highlights how difficult it will be to rewrite the rules.There is a school of thought that perhaps it is not worth the time and effort. The belief that F.F.P. is not doing what it was supposed to do has become a truism: An idea introduced almost a decade ago to improve soccer\u2019s financial health and to decrease its reliance on debt has become, instead, a tool to entrench the status quo, to lock ambitious clubs out of the golden circle.Criticism, though, is easier than construction. If Financial Fair Play is jettisoned, if Manchester City\u2019s vindication proves to be its death knell, one question lingers: What comes next?It should not be a surprise that two of the clubs to take advantage of the relaxation of the rules this summer most quickly, Chelsea and Paris St.-Germain, have the sort of benefactors able to thrive in a world without financial regulation. Inter Milan, too, has long found F.F.P. inhibitive. Manchester City, meanwhile, is planning an overhaul of its squad. It will not come cheap.ImageParis St.-Germain, like Manchester City, prevailed over UEFA in an F.F.P. case.Credit...Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersThis moment is a window into what soccer\u2019s landscape might look like without financial control: the teams with the most generous owners and the deepest pockets bending the market to their whim, cherry-picking the poor, challenging their rivals to match them or to sink into mediocrity. Perhaps that is as it should be: the strong rising and the weak falling and fading.Except, of course, soccer has been there before, in an age of unrestrained spending. At the start of the 2010s, UEFA found that European soccer as a whole was $1.9 billion in debt. The turnaround, over the last 10 years, has been remarkable. In 2017, the continent\u2019s clubs turned a profit of $680 million. The change, of course, was the introduction of Financial Fair Play.That is soccer\u2019s problem: Inherently, unapologetically tribal, it settles on the small answers and ignores the big questions. In Manchester City\u2019s eyes, Financial Fair Play was designed, exclusively, to limit its ambitions. In the eyes of English or Spanish or Italian fans, it was created to stop arriviste wealth from distorting the sport\u2019s economics.But elsewhere, it has proved crucial. It has enabled UEFA to ensure that clubs in smaller markets \u2014 where the concerns are not who wins the Champions League \u2014 meet their debts and obligations by wielding the threat of expulsion from money-spinning European competitions.F.F.P. has always looked like a paper tiger to the big clubs; for smaller teams, it has had teeth. That is its weakness, but it is also its strength. In its absence, it is in the places where it has had the most effect that the consequences will be felt: not for the clubs that can spend to their hearts\u2019 content, but to the clubs that can risk their very existence for short-term success.What comes next for Manchester City? The sky is the limit. For much of the rest of Europe, the trajectory may be very different."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/soccer/manchester-city-champions-league.html", "title": "Manchester City\u2019s Champions League Ban Is Overturned", "summary": "The club, one of the world\u2019s richest teams, had faced a two-year exile from Europe\u2019s top soccer competition. Its victory is a blow to the credibility of UEFA\u2019s cost control rules.", "authors": "By Tariq Panja", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Almost as soon as it was accused of breaking European soccer\u2019s cost control rules, Manchester City dug in and began the fight to clear its name.It criticized the hackers who leaked private club documents and the media organizations that reported on them. It railed against the accusations (\u201centirely false\u201d) and the process (\u201cunfair\u201d) and, most of all, the punishment: a two-year ban from the Champions League.City officials vowed to do \u201ceverything that can be done\u201d to fight the ban. Bankrolled by one of the world\u2019s richest men, they seemed prepared to spend any sum to prevail.What few knew was that City\u2019s salvation was there in plain sight the whole time: a handful of words in a section of the rules of UEFA, European soccer\u2019s governing body. Those rules set a five-year time limit on the infractions eligible for punishment and, in effect, barred investigators from ruling on some of the most serious accusations against City.They also allowed a three-member panel at the Court of Arbitration for Sport to rule Monday to overturn the Champions League ban, imposed last year for what UEFA had called \u201cserious breaches\u201d of cost control regulations. In announcing its decision, the panel cited UEFA\u2019s rules, which it said meant many of the most serious findings against City \u2014 whether true or not \u2014 were inadmissible.The decision was not only a triumph of a technicality. CAS also found, and UEFA agreed, that there was \u201cinsufficient conclusive evidence\u201d to uphold all of the conclusions that had resulted in the Champions League ban.A fine of 30 million euros (about $34 million) was reduced to 10 million ($11.3 million), an acknowledgment that City had in fact breached some regulations by failing to cooperate with the investigation. But on the most important issues, City\u2019s victory was complete.\u201cThe club welcomes the implications of today\u2019s ruling as a validation of the club\u2019s position and the body of evidence that it was able to present,\u201d Manchester City said in a brief statement.The lifting of the Champions League ban, which had hung over Manchester City for more than a year and raised questions about the club\u2019s finances and its credibility, will have significant consequences for both the team and UEFA.Manchester City officials had vehemently, and repeatedly, denied any accusations of wrongdoing, and the prospect of being barred from the Champions League risked upending one of the most ambitious projects in global sports.For UEFA, the latest high-profile reversal of its effort to uphold its so-called financial fair-play regulations \u2014 and the second time its own rules have been at the root of its defeat \u2014 has created new doubts about the future of its efforts to police overspending by its biggest clubs, and its ability and willingness to police its members\u2019 actions.The CAS panel said in a statement posted on the court\u2019s website that the most serious breaches found by UEFA were either \u201cnot established\u201d or no longer relevant (in the court\u2019s words, \u201ctime-barred\u201d).Manchester City remains in contention to win the Champions League this year; it won the first leg of its round-of-16 tie against Real Madrid in March before the coronavirus pandemic forced a temporary halt to the event. UEFA is scheduled to resume the competition this summer.Since being acquired in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the billionaire brother of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Manchester City has risen from relative obscurity to become one of soccer\u2019s most valuable and successful brands. It fields one of the best teams in the world and is led by Pep Guardiola, the Spanish coach who oversaw its collecting every available trophy in English soccer last season.Monday\u2019s ruling means the team will continue to perform on one of sports\u2019 biggest stages, and one of its most lucrative. City had stood to lose about $200 million in Champions League payments from a two-year ban, but it would also have been costly in terms of damage to City\u2019s carefully cultivated reputation and its ability to attract top players and coaches. Now it will remain among the favorites to win the competition year after year.ImageHundreds of millions of dollars in investments in players, coaches and facilities transformed Manchester City into one of the world\u2019s top clubs.Credit...Laurence Griffiths/Agence France-Presse, via Pool/Afp Via Getty ImagesInstead, it will be UEFA that faces new scrutiny. It is the second time UEFA has been judged to have fallen afoul of its own statutes of limitations. In a previous case, involving another wealthy Gulf-owned team, Paris St.-Germain, CAS agreed with P.S.G. that the adjudicatory arm of UEFA\u2019s financial control body had not acted in time.UEFA on Monday acknowledged in a statement that the panel found that many of the breaches attributed to City \u201cwere time-barred due to the five-year time period foreseen in the UEFA regulations,\u201d but it appeared eager to put the case behind it. \u201cUEFA will be making no further comments on the matter,\u201d it said.But UEFA\u2019s ability and willingness to police its regulations sustained a blow. Financial investigators in the City case had sought advice from UEFA\u2019s in-house legal team before starting work on the case, and had asked about the statute of limitations, according to a person familiar with the organization\u2019s discussions.The rules were created in 2009 as several top European clubs teetered on the brink of bankruptcy and have largely proved to be successful, though they have worked against clubs like City, P.S.G. and others as their wealthy owners have sought to supplant more established powers.Lawyers for City and UEFA presented their arguments to the panel during a video hearing in early June. City had said it would spare no resource to defend itself. It contended that the UEFA process was one-sided and that an impartial body like CAS would overturn the ruling, which came after damaging leaks in 2018 that suggested the team had engaged in illegal accounting tactics to get around UEFA\u2019s cost control rules.Citing internal documents and emails, those reports suggested City had disguised millions of dollars of direct investment by its owner, Sheikh Mansour, as sponsorship income. One document, published by the German weekly Der Spiegel, appeared to show that the team\u2019s main sponsor, the Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, had paid only a fraction of an $85 million sponsorship agreement.City had denounced the publication of stolen documents as \u201cout-of-context materials purportedly hacked or stolen,\u201d contending that the leaks were part of an \u201corganized and clear attempt to damage the club\u2019s reputation.\u201dIts rivals had demanded serious punishment, though, leaving UEFA and its president, Aleksander Ceferin, squeezed by powerful, and wealthy, forces on both sides. Ceferin said he had no role in UEFA\u2019s investigation, which was handled independently by a group responsible for scrutinizing clubs\u2019 adherence to fiscal rules. That group, known as the Club Financial Control Body, ruled against City, adding the fine of 30 million euros on top of the ban.ImageManchester City\u2019s appeal of its Champions League ban was a direct challenge to UEFA\u2019s authority.Credit...Laurence Griffiths/ReutersThe rules had not stopped City from winning. It captured two straight Premier League titles, in 2018 and 2019, and had won everything but the Champions League title, the crown its owners covet most. It has another chance to win it in August, when the event is set to conclude with a knockout tournament in Lisbon featuring eight quarterfinalists.Manchester City\u2019s appeal of its ban was being closely watched by other teams, though, including several that stood to gain had City\u2019s original punishment been upheld. Others in European soccer had felt the stakes were even higher, raising doubts about the authority of soccer bodies to police clubs now owned by powerful state interests.\u201cHard to see how UEFA\u2019s FFP rules can survive this,\u201d Gary Lineker, a former England player and now a popular broadcaster, wrote on Twitter. \u201cIn fact, can UEFA survive the ramifications?\u201dUltimately, City was able to declare victory. Apart from its legal costs, the club\u2019s failure to cooperate with UEFA\u2019s investigators cost it only 10 million euros, far less than City routinely pays for a new player to join its roster."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/basketball/amanda-zahui-b-new-york-liberty.html", "title": "She Found Her Voice in a W.N.B.A. Locker Room, Then Used It in Sweden", "summary": "", "authors": "By Seth Berkman", "text": "Four years ago, the Liberty became one of the first professional sports franchises to make a unified on-court statement against police brutality and racial injustice. Even before Colin Kaepernick drew widespread attention for kneeling during the N.F.L. preseason later that summer, the Liberty took the court for a game wearing black shirts that said #BlackLivesMatter.That summer had a profound impact on Liberty center Amanda Zahui B., who had arrived in the United States just three years earlier, to attend the University of Minnesota.In a locker room led by Tina Charles, Swin Cash, Tanisha Wright and Carolyn Swords, Zahui B. absorbed herself in discussions with nuanced views of race, mental health and womanhood.Those conversations came rushing back to mind recently for Zahui B., the daughter of a French-Spanish mother and father from the Ivory Coast, after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.She had been quarantining in her hometown, Stockholm, when she learned about Floyd\u2019s death. Initially, she felt beckoned to the marches in Minneapolis and the ones outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the Liberty\u2019s future home arena.She then recalled something her former Liberty teammates had emphasized to international players years ago: the importance of pushing for change abroad, not only in the United States.And so, before she returned to Brooklyn to prepare for the start of the W.N.B.A. season at the end of this month, Zahui B. focused her efforts on issues in Sweden, promoting protests and boycotts to drive Swedes to confront what she described as an unspoken history of racial inequality.\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about race here,\u201d Zahui B., 26, said last month from her apartment in Dalen, located in the Southside of Stockholm. \u201cMinneapolis, I wanted to march the streets with everyone. I wanted to do whatever I can do for that community. But at the same time, we have so much work to do in Sweden. You have to start at home.\u201dZahui B. grew up in neighborhoods heavily populated by African immigrants who, like her father, Alex Zahui Bazoukou, toiled to find work in Stockholm. Last year, the Swedish government reported 231,276 African Swedes living in the country.Zahui B.\u2019s mother, Ann-Sofi, who was born in Sweden and settled in Stockholm after a nomadic childhood, helped start Sara Bokhandel, which claims to be the first Kurdish bookstore in Europe. Zahui B. recalled rifling through children\u2019s books translated into Arabic, like the Swedish classic \u201cPippi Longstocking.\u201dBut as she grew up, Zahui B. found that the diverse environments she was raised in were largely ignored in much of Sweden.As an example, she pointed to media representations. There is the popular show \u201cSvenska Hollywoodfruar\u201d (\u201cSwedish Hollywood Wives\u201d), which features a cast of blond-haired and blue-eyed women. And in televised games of the Swedish women\u2019s national team, Zahui B. said, broadcasters flock to her over teammates with darker complexions.\u201cWe don\u2019t really promote people of color out here, and if we do, we are very light,\u201d Zahui B. said. Sofia Ulver, a marketing professor at Lund University in Sweden, agreed that race was seldom talked about in Sweden. She helped write a study submitted for peer review earlier this month that examined racial and ethnic representation in Swedish television commercials.Ulver noted a history of legislative efforts in Sweden that have sought to negate race as a concrete source of bias to be considered in lawmaking \u2014 an approach that some critics argue ignores the existence of actual racism.\u201cWe have huge integration problems in Sweden,\u201d said Ulver, who added that before World War II, Sweden openly promoted the concept of genetic superiority among certain races. \u201cWe have not been good at integrating new multicultural groups that are coming in. It\u2019s hugely segregated.\u201dZahui B. said her family always encouraged open dialogue, but it wasn\u2019t until a May 2016 trade to the Liberty that she became comfortable with expressing vulnerability.Zahui B., who said she had wrestled as a child with the concept of \u201cbeing Black in Europe and being viewed as a white person when I\u2019m in the Ivory Coast,\u201d said Charles challenged her to think deeply about what it means to be a Black woman in the modern world.\u201cYou see now people coming from a point of separation to: How do we come together for one thing to affect change?\u201d said Wright, who is now an assistant coach with the Las Vegas Aces. \u201cDuring that season, we were already there. We were a microcosm of what we happen to see now.\u201dEventually, Zahui B. felt comfortable enough to drive conversations about what actions the team should take throughout the 2016 season. That summer, the Liberty wore black warm-up shirts with messages supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and staged a media blackout, and at least one player sat during the national anthem. Cash began asking Zahui B. about race in Sweden, which led to discussions about the similar issues in the two countries.Image\u201cI\u2019m being kind of direct and planting a seed in people\u2019s heads,\u201d Amanda Zahui B. said.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times\u201cShe started to unlay herself and became outspoken, someone who wanted to impact and leave a lasting impression on you,\u201d said Charles, who is now with the Washington Mystics.For Zahui B., those conversations allowed her to elucidate emotions that had previously felt muted and muddled \u2014 feelings that stemmed from being followed around stores and banks in Stockholm, her instinct to drive with two hands on the steering wheel and with her driver\u2019s license out next to her in case she was pulled over.\u201cSometimes I have a wall up because I know how the world is,\u201d Zahui B. said. \u201cI speak up, and I\u2019m going to get something back. But learning how to really show that I\u2019m actually human \u2014 like, I cry myself to sleep, I have nightmares, we all go through depression and we are all scared and upset \u2014 that\u2019s kind of like the growth I\u2019ve had, especially since coming to the Liberty.\u201dLast month, Zahui B. discussed the idea of organizing a Black Lives Matter protest in Stockholm with her agent and local activists before joining one already planned for June 3. Zahui B. publicized the march on Instagram, where she estimates a majority of her 15,000-plus followers are Swedish.Emboldened by the thousands of Swedes who marched, Zahui B. contacted all of the major news stations in Sweden, offering to discuss race on live air. In response, some radio stations proposed interviews about basketball, instead.\u201cI said no,\u201d Zahui B. said. \u201cI want to talk about what really matters.\u201d She added that she has refrained from giving interviews with certain Swedish stations until they made a concerted effort to address race in their coverage.As an alternative, Zahui B. has begun posting unfiltered Instagram videos about race to her largely Swedish audience.Zahui B. said it did not bother her if such conversations were uncomfortable for viewers, as she considers them necessary for progress. After the June 3 protest, for example, her neighbor greeted her in the hallway of her building and asked how she was doing.She responded that she was tired of seeing Black people unjustifiably killed, and said that if he didn\u2019t want to have a conversation about that, then he didn\u2019t have to speak to her ever again.\u201cI\u2019m being kind of direct and planting a seed in people\u2019s heads,\u201d Zahui B. said. \u201cI do not need you to tell me you\u2019re sorry or that you understand how I feel. I need you to actually make a change and go home and have a conversation with your family, with your kids.\u201cWhen you go to work and hear somebody say something that is inappropriate, speak up. Speak up even if it\u2019s uncomfortable.

He wondered if Spectrum\u2019s kits \u2014 which require customers to spit in a tube and ship their samples through the mail \u2014 could work with detecting this new virus.\u201cI just threw it out there: Why don\u2019t we test our device to see if we can use it as a transport medium to get it to the lab?\u201d Phillips recalled in a recent telephone interview.Spectrum, based outside Salt Lake City, teamed up with a laboratory at Rutgers University, made a few tweaks and found that the effectiveness of their saliva test kit was comparable to the nasopharyngeal test, or the long swab, that was already in widespread use.By mid-April, the Food and Drug Administration granted the Rutgers lab an emergency-use authorization. A month later, it received approval for the test kit to be used at home.That saliva kit is now a key part of Major League Baseball\u2019s plan to return to play, and has also been used by other revived sports leagues, including the PGA Tour and Major League Soccer.With sports leagues desperate to salvage their seasons and profits, testing was always crucial \u2014 even more so now as the number of cases rises nationwide. But there was no blueprint, so a patchwork of businesses and labs, all with entirely different missions before the pandemic, converged to meet the need.A version of Spectrum\u2019s spit test, once used to help figure out family trees, is now spotting infections. Vault Health, a telehealth company that was focused on sexual health and weight-loss therapies for men, is now using Spectrum\u2019s saliva kit and the Rutgers lab to help leagues conduct wide-scale testing. And the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Utah, which previously handled antidoping testing for M.L.B., is now processing coronavirus saliva tests for the league.Dr. Daniel Eichner, the president and laboratory director of SMRTL, the shorthand name for the Utah lab doing M.L.B.\u2019s coronavirus testing, acknowledged that there was \u201cnothing good about this virus.\u201d But, he said, he was proud of his team\u2019s ability to pivot to this new challenge, like other companies.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful American story: When the chips are down, people jump in to contribute as best they can,\u201d Dr. Eichner said.Seeing an OpportunityNavigating the rapidly evolving world of coronavirus testing has been far from a simple task for professional sports leagues.

On a recent podcast episode, Wojnarowski said he had sent a number of packages to the Orlando area in advance of his planned arrival on Sunday.Hours after sending the email, Wojnarowski apologized, saying he was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cmade a regrettable mistake.\u201d ESPN called his email \u201cinexcusable\u201d and said it would address it with him internally.

Hawley has been known to selectively criticize the N.B.A.\u2019s relationship with China.The N.B.A. has been a frequent target for many Republicans since the league\u2019s rift with China began before the season started. Several castigated the N.B.A. \u2014 accusing the league of not firmly standing behind Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager, who posted an image on Twitter that was supportive of the pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters in October. This incensed the Chinese government, which has since limited its business with the N.B.A.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, even called for the N.B.A. commissioner, Adam Silver, to testify on the subject. When prominent and frequently outspoken league figures like Steve Kerr, LeBron James and James Harden were asked about Morey\u2019s comments, they either demurred or declined to support Morey.When it comes to the leader of their own party, President Trump, Republicans have mostly been silent, including after Trump said to Axios that he wanted to avoid punishing China for its mass internment of ethnic Uighurs last year because of ongoing trade talks. Trump has also spoken warmly about President Xi Jinping of China, referring to him as \u201ca friend of mine\u201d and \u201can incredible guy,\u201d and urged the country to investigate the Bidens.After Wojnarowski\u2019s tweet, conservative critics like the sports blogger Clay Travis pounced. Travis sarcastically tweeted about ESPN\u2019s \u201cleft-wing bias,\u201d and Hawley reshared that tweet with his followers. Travis\u2019s site, Outkick, later was first to report about Wojnarowski\u2019s suspension.For years, conservative critics, and often some competitors, have accused ESPN of liberal bias and claimed, with little evidence, that it has resulted in lower ratings. Still, Jimmy Pitaro, who became ESPN\u2019s president in 2018, has sought to steer the network in a direction that focuses more on what happens on the field. In the last few months, that position has been challenged, as there have been few sports to cover because of the coronavirus pandemic and as athletes have spoken out about racism in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in police custody.Sopan Deb contributed reporting."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/sports/football/nfl-union-disability-payments.html", "title": "Two Ex-Players Sue N.F.L. and Union Over Cuts in Disability Payments", "summary": "The N.F.L. and the players association agreed in a new labor deal in March to reduce payments to 400 former players who cannot work.", "authors": "By Ken Belson", "text": "Two former N.F.L. players have sued the league, the players\u2019 union and the medical board those institutions jointly control for agreeing to reduce the disability payments they received for life by tens of thousands of dollars a year.The complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on Friday, stems from a provision in the 10-year collective bargaining agreement that the league and union ratified in March. In the deal, both sides agreed to cut disability payments to 400 or so former players whose doctors have determined they are unable to work.The players now receive up to $138,000 a year. That amount will be reduced by the value of their Social Security disability benefits, which amounts to $2,000 or more per month, starting in January.The decision to cut payments to some of the league\u2019s most vulnerable former players has elicited outrage. Wives caring for former players on disability have criticized the N.F.L. on social media. Some members of the union\u2019s executive committee said they did not fully recognize the implications of what they agreed to in the new labor deal. Active players have spoken up, too, most notably Eric Reid, a free-agent safety who said the union turned its back on the former players, a decision he called \u201cdisgraceful.\u201dIn May, the N.F.L. Players Association said it planned to review the provisions in the new collective bargaining agreement that pertain to the reduction in benefits to permanently disabled former players.Cleveland Browns center J.C. Tretter, the N.F.L.P.A. president, who was elected in March, said in his monthly newsletter that the union\u2019s 11-member executive committee and leaders from among retired players would re-examine changes to the Total and Permanent Disability benefit \u201cto fulfill our obligation to all of our members.\u201d He also said the group had \u201ca responsibility to review issues where we have fallen short.\u201dTwo months later, the union has not announced any results from that review.Tretter and other members of the executive committee will also reconsider a provision of the new labor agreement that allows only N.F.L. disability plan doctors to determine if a former player qualifies for benefits. For now, if a player is approved to receive Social Security disability benefits by an outside doctor, N.F.L. plan administrators will accept that diagnosis and release monthly benefits. This provision, which will be phased out under the agreement, could affect hundreds of additional players in the future.The union, the league and their disability review board will now have to consider the federal lawsuit brought by Aveion Cason, a running back who played for eight seasons, mostly in Detroit and St. Louis, and Donald Vincent Majkowski, a quarterback who spent 10 years with the Packers, Colts and Lions.In their suit, they note that Commissioner Roger Goodell told Congress in 2007 that if a player was approved for Social Security disability payments, then the N.F.L. would honor that diagnosis. The new labor deal reverses that promise.Cason and Majkowski also contend that language in the labor agreement was altered after it was signed, to the detriment of the former players who rely on disability payments.

Lewis is also one of 10 African-American players expected to be on Seattle\u2019s 40-man roster on opening day \u2014 an eye-popping number in an era when American-born Black players in the big leagues are rare.With his Mariners convening in Seattle for workouts at T-Mobile Park, Lewis said he has never wavered on his commitment to play, even as he\u2019s watched colleagues contract the coronavirus and helped protest racial injustice.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.I\u2019m definitely tuned-in and paying attention to the guys who are deciding not to play. I want to know about the decisions that guys are making and understand their reasoning. Me as a ballplayer going back to the game, Covid-19 is something I think about every day. And the fact that there are players that are getting sick is something I think about seriously.I\u2019ve never thought about sitting out. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t want to confuse that with me not thinking about the risks of it. I\u2019m fully aware of the risk and I am definitely not comfortable with everything, but at the same time baseball has laid out a health and safety protocol and they are trying to do their best to keep us safe.

In cities including New Orleans; Chicago; and Bowling Green, Ohio, musicians and community organizers have continued to host violin vigils \u2014 almost 20, and counting \u2014 in honor of Mr. McClain, attracting hundreds, sometimes thousands, of participants.VideoMusicians honor Elijah McClain\u2019s memory with \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d and other selections.CreditCredit...Carlos Javier Ortiz for The New York Times\u201cI remember just making a poster for the vigil on my phone,\u201d said Karla Mi Lugo, a performance artist who helped organize the initial event in Aurora. \u201cI\u2019ve had at least 10 different people in different cities who have reached out to me about organizing their own.\u201dThe renewed attention to the circumstances of Mr. McClain\u2019s death has had an impact. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the case. And three Aurora police officers have been fired over photos taken near a memorial set up in Mr. McClain\u2019s memory that show two of them grinning and mocking his death.As the violin vigils proliferate, hordes of classically trained performers are at the ready: Concert halls have been closed for months because of the spread of the coronavirus, leaving musicians out of work around the country. Organizers in Boston; Columbus, Ohio; and Portland all reported a similar pattern: Events planned in just a few days are receiving swift bursts of response, and impressive turnouts.\u201cWe had no idea this was going to happen,\u201d Mr. Floyd said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think we\u2019d create these waves. But I guess that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a musician and all you have is time on your hands.\u201dAlexandra Newman, a lead organizer of the Chicago vigil, pointed to two local classical music standbys that were canceled this summer, the Grant Park Music Festival and the Ravinia Festival, as an explanation for the interest in the event there.\u201cThere are people who want to hear music, and there are people who want to perform it,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a community aspect, and it\u2019s a way to bring out that connection.\u201dImageJeff Hughes plays at the vigil in June in Aurora, Colo., where Mr. McClain was taken into custody.Credit...Kevin Mohatt/ReutersWithout any national umbrella organization, the vigils have been put together by local residents. While organizers have tended to handle the logistics, picking the location and spreading the word, musicians have created sheet music and distributed it. Violins, of course, have been the most popular choice at the events, though violas, cellos and other string instruments have made appearances. There has been an effort to include music by Black composers, or songs that are important to the Black community, like \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been trying to change, not using so many European composers,\u201d said Kevin Hagans, a violinist who is Black and Japanese and helped organize the vigil in Columbus. \u201cThe issue is that we\u2019ve always had to go searching for these composers; they\u2019re not taught to us like white composers are.\u201dWhile many musicians are joyful at getting any chance to perform after months without concerts, they noted that this occasion is somber. \u201cI\u2019m really conflicted,\u201d Zack Brock, a violinist for the band Snarky Puppy, said about his experience helping organize the vigil in Maplewood, N.J. \u201cIt felt horrible that the first time I got to perform since the pandemic was because a Black man was killed by the police. I missed playing for people, because it\u2019s been so long. But I was really just there because I wanted to help.\u201dThis sentiment is shared by Mr. Floyd and Mr. England, who were at first concerned that people might confuse the vigils for self-promotion or celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the name of Elijah McClain,\u201d Mr. England said. \u201cAnd I really hope that people see that there\u2019s more than just one way to protest. We don\u2019t want this to just be some P.R. thing.\u201dMr. England recalled an exchange with the Aurora mayor\u2019s communications office, which contacted him a few days after the vigil there. The mayor\u2019s office, he said, knew that they \u201chad messed up\u201d because the police department had interfered with the protest, and wanted to \u201cmake it up\u201d \u2014 to him and Mr. Floyd.\u201cI told them that they need to do what needs to be done for the McClain family,\u201d Mr. England said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about any of us.

Huxley had an obsession with zippers, and the costume designer Susie Coulthard honored it. But she embedded those zippers in vanguard materials, partnering with the Swiss textile innovators Jakob Schlaepfer on fabrics that have an oily or glassine appearance. A few outfits are made of balloon latex.\u201cI felt so immersed in what I was doing by what I was wearing,\u201d Brown Findlay, a veteran of period shows like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and \u201cHarlots\u201d said. \u201cThat\u2019s saying something when you\u2019ve worn a lot of huge giant corseted dresses.\u201dHuxley\u2019s technology needed updates even beyond textiles, mostly because a lot of what he imagined (videoconferencing, television, test-tube babies) has already come to pass. Even his self-driving aircraft are in the works.The novel\u2019s utopian vision, with its ugly flares of racism and misogyny, also required renovation. \u201cThe book\u2019s hugely problematic,\u201d Wiener said. So the show pivoted toward equality, race-bending and gender-flipping several of the supporting characters.\u201cIt turns out there\u2019s nothing about those characters that necessarily needed to be white or male,\u201d Wiener said.The main characters have undergone some changes, too. Lenina, a cheerful sex bunny in the book, has been granted interiority. Pompous Bernard has softened. In the novel, John is prissy and deeply neurotic, anti-sex and anti-fun.\u201cIt\u2019d be a little like taking Mike Pence to New London,\u201d Wiener quipped. \u201cNo one would want to watch that.\u201dSo Ehrenreich\u2019s John has loosened up and muscled up, though he remains extremely emo. Ehrenreich, best known as the titular swashbuckler in \u201cSolo,\u201d prefers to describe John as romantic.\u201cThe only thing he has to hold onto in is his ardent belief in a deep, emotional love,\u201d he said.If the novel traffics mostly in satire, the tone here is more ambivalent. It gets to have its promiscuity \u2014 what is prestige TV, after all, without the occasional orgy? \u2014 and moralize about it, too.Maybe you will share that ambivalence. After all, a society organized around pleasure \u2014 consequence-free sex, party drugs, renewable fashion \u2014 doesn\u2019t sound terrible. \u201cThere were definitely moments on set where we were like, this is pretty good,\u201d Ehrenreich said.But possibly that\u2019s just the prop soma talking. One of the novel\u2019s spikier and more resonant points is that entertainment is its own drug, numbing us against discomfort. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we definitely recognize today,\u201d Lloyd, who plays Bernard, said. \u201cThe moment where you sit on your own in the darkness to question what it\u2019s all about, there\u2019s so many things to do on your phone.\u201d\u201cBrave New World\u201d \u2014 available soon on the Peacock app! \u2014 is one more of them. Yes, it traffics in philosophy and muses upon \u201cthe relationship between happiness and freedom, and what you\u2019re willing to risk of each for the other,\u201d Lloyd said.But as Olmstead, the Universal Content president, told me \u2014 twice \u2014 the show shouldn\u2019t feel like homework. How much thinking will you do while you watch the buildings, the clothes, the toned bodies, the glowing skin? How well do sex and social critique actually mix? Well enough for more seasons, Wiener hopes.Huxley didn\u2019t foresee this exact moment. (Very few of us had both a global pandemic and an overdue racial reckoning on our 2020 bingo card.) But the idea of a computer in every pocket, a social media feed for every mood, entertainment on demand and life as livestream wouldn\u2019t have surprised him.Perhaps he can even imagine us now, pulling up Peacock, clicking on one \u201cBrave New World\u201d episode and then another.

But now the 65-year-old Van Halen singer is just like the rest of us: stuck at home and obsessing about pandemics.However, the past few months in quarantine have led Roth to an old pursuit, with new focus. Since April, he has filled his days creating Covid-themed drawings \u2014 he calls them comics \u2014 and then sharing the finished works, one each week, on his social media channels. The art, like Roth\u2019s music and disposition, is vibrant, whimsical and somewhat unconventional. In moments, it is confrontational. Several drawings feature his own face. Many are filled with images of frogs.What sparked this surge of artistic expression?\u201cWell, I lost my job!\u201d Roth cracked over the phone from his home in Los Angeles on an afternoon in late June. As recently as March, Roth was on tour as a solo act, supporting Kiss in arenas across the United States. Earlier in that run, Roth, who has also worked as an E.M.T. in New York, had battled an unspecified illness. \u201cI\u2019m not so unconvinced I didn\u2019t have the corona,\u201d he said. \u201cMan, they gave me enough prednisone to put boots on the moon! We left a trail of groupies, rubble and incandescent reviews. But I don\u2019t want to go back through it.\u201dEven by rock frontman standards, Roth\u2019s ability to command full attention from his audience is renowned, whether he\u2019s launching himself off drum risers for midair splits or schooling fans on how Van Halen is \u201cthe rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band who sold Ricky Ricardo rumba to the heavy metal nation.\u201d But now his art is doing the talking. \u201cSocial commentary is what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done.\u201dImageRoth said that his artwork is social commentary and the pieces don\u2019t have titles.Credit...Jessica Lehrman for The New York TimesIn his recent artwork, that social commentary has elicited a strong response. In one piece, he declares a name change. \u201cDiamond Dave following Lady Antebellum\u2019s (now \u2018Lady A\u2019) example, will be dropping the \u2018Lee,\u2019\u201d he wrote below a drawing of, naturally, a frog. \u201cFrom now on he wants us all to call him \u2018David L. Roth\u2019 or simply \u2018El Roth.\u2019\u201d To many, it diminished the steps white artists are taking to correct racism.\u201cHumor \u2014 not jokes \u2014 humor, the best stuff, isn\u2019t funny at all,\u201d Roth said, defending his work. \u201cMy version is the truth dipped in sugar. And maybe it\u2019s a little sugar and spice. But the good stuff compels discussions.\u201dArt, he continued, \u201chas been a constant in my life. My hand has always been in wardrobe, background sets, stage sets, album covers, video direction. This is part of it. And there\u2019s craft involved, so there\u2019s a little bit more heft to some of the statements.\u201dRoth laughed. \u201cThis is the adult table; as a fellow artist, I sense you understand that.\u201dAnother laugh.\u201cNext question!\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why frogs?I saw a story about Mark Twain \u2014 it was not his biography, it was a fictional piece with actors. And at the end of it ol\u2019 Sam passes on, but he doesn\u2019t go to heaven. He\u2019s in the backyard where he grew up in Hannibal, Mo. And a little girl walks up and he goes, \u201cWho are you?\u201d She says, \u201cI\u2019m Becky Thatcher, and I\u2019ve got some friends who are waiting to meet you.\u201d And all the characters that he created come on up to greet him. So, I started my guest list. And probably the only one of that retinue that I could even spell, much less draw, was the frog from Calaveras County [from the short story \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\u201d].Many of your drawings include a reference to the \u201cSoggy Bottom.\u201d I took this, at least in this context, to be a play on the phrase \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201dIf I explain it, it\u2019s a bumper sticker. If I let you explain it, it\u2019s art. But you\u2019re very close to exactly accurate.ImageCredit...David Lee RothCan you describe your artistic process?My approach is the best of both worlds: vintage and hyper-atomic digital. Sort of like watching \u201cDragnet\u201d on your iPad. You know, I moved to Japan for two-plus years to study Sumi-e and calligraphy, and four nights a week I trained and then I did homework. Jesus, I\u2019ve spent thousands of hours learning to operate a horsehair brush with a block of ink that I grind myself. Hasn\u2019t changed its recipe in 700 years.So everything in the comics is hand-drawn \u2014 all the typeface, all the colors, the line work, the lighting. And once I\u2019m done, I work with Colin Smith, the Led Zeppelin of Adobe Photoshop. Together we scan everything, and then I\u2019m able to move into areas that otherwise weren\u2019t graphically available without decades of effort.ImageCredit...David Lee RothHow does using digital manipulation transform the original work?Many of these colors can\u2019t be found outside the cyberverse. It\u2019s a world unto itself. Serves a well purpose, because almost all of our fine arts and graphic consumption these days is interactive with a screen, whether it\u2019s on your PC or your wristwatch. We\u2019re actually back to Maxwell Smart and his shoe phone. \u201cSomebody is on my Nike!\u201dWhat appeals to you about using brush and ink as a means of artistic expression?Hold on. This isn\u2019t expressing myself. This is performance therapy. I\u2019m venting. I\u2019m angry. And I am not asking for forgiveness. And this is how I do it.People don\u2019t usually think of David Lee Roth as angry.That\u2019s because I have transcended it. It is that secret magic when you take something that is essentially sad and find humor, eloquence and sometimes illumination in it.What is your view of this country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic?I sure wish our country had taken a Marine Corps approach to Covid. Instead of [creating] a divide, good or bad, right or reasonable, wrong or otherwise.One of your pieces features the phrase \u201cNo politics during happy hour,\u201d which feels to me like it could be an encapsulation of the Van Halen ethos.Well, visually and graphically, the frogs underneath that caption are fighting \u2014 identical to what happened in my brief and colorful tenure with the Van Halens. [Laughs] But when you see Technicolor frogs doing it, it\u2019s a bit more digestible. But what I\u2019m reflecting on in that comic is the unstated. That which we don\u2019t talk about. What does happen when we drink at happy hour and talk politics? What does it mean when we say, \u201cAlcohol sales skyrocket again\u201d? It\u2019s all a bit of a diversion.ImageCredit...David Lee RothCan you say more about the piece that seems to be a response to Lady Antebellum\u2019s name change?It had connotations of personal politic. I sought to have a little fun at the expense of others, whose vision I will respect. And in lieu of the inevitable false-footed copycats I pretended to be one. But the supposed name change really drew some ire in terms of some folks posting from an arch right-wing stance: \u201cAnother left-winger takes a fall.\u201d Hey, I\u2019m a combat hippie \u2014 peace, love and enough guys and gears to defend the [expletive] out of it. You need one to support the other.ImageCredit...David Lee RothWould it be correct to identify David Lee Roth as left-leaning?I love civil rights. Equal rights. Women\u2019s rights. Kids\u2019 rights. The rights of the rights. OK? The entire list. But conversely, I\u2019m prepared to shave my head, join the Marines and go defend those rights. That in itself isn\u2019t really a left-wing statement. Or it didn\u2019t used to be when I was growing up. But I grew up in a really great time and a really great space during integrational busing in the \u201960s. I went to schools that were 90 percent Black and Spanish, and I was in the color guard with a crew cut. Every morning at seven we\u2019d march to put up the flag. And then at night we\u2019d go to Kenny Brower\u2019s brother\u2019s house, smoke pot and listen to that new Doors record. Combat hippie!You were on tour when the lockdown began. As a lifelong performer, was it difficult being forced to leave the road so hastily?Every Jiu-Jitsu magazine has a 28-year-old who\u2019s going to tell you about the two years that got taken away by his elbow. Every kickboxing magazine has a 32-year-old instructor who goes, \u201cWell, I lost those three years to my left knee.\u201d So I\u2019ve just been isolating away. Because I myself am high risk.Why do you consider yourself high risk?The road will deteriorate you from the beginning or it will keep you alive forever. When we go out, we wear ourselves to a nubbin. I just had a lower back surgery. It was a spinal fusion where they take a chip from somebody else. I\u2019m actually taller now. Do I seem taller? I mean, over the phone?Image\u201cThe road will deteriorate you from the beginning or it will keep you alive forever,\u201d Roth said.Credit...Jessica Lehrman for The New York TimesYou last toured with Van Halen in 2015. Do you think it\u2019ll ever happen again?I don\u2019t know that Eddie [Van Halen] is ever really going to rally for the rigors of the road again. [The guitarist first announced he had cancer in 2001, and it has recurred since.] I don\u2019t even want to say I\u2019ve waited \u2014 I\u2019ve supported for five years. Because what I do is physical as well as musical and spiritual \u2014 you can\u2019t take five years off from the ring. But I did. And I do not regret a second of it. He\u2019s a band mate. We had a colleague down. And he\u2019s down now for enough time that I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s going to be coming back out on the road. You want to hear the classics? You\u2019re talking to him.For how long will we continue to see new artwork from David Lee Roth?Like the tattoo artist said, \u2019til I don\u2019t have any friends left! Until my Instagram\u2019s empty! I can do this endlessly. I hadn\u2019t considered this as something other than after dinner at the campfire. But lo and behold, people have taken a real fascination.Given that fascination, will these drawings eventually be offered for sale?In terms of what I really do for a living, as soon as the B-list \u2014 that\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9, Bono and Bruce [Springsteen] \u2014 say it\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll be back singing and dancing and selling you T-shirts. But in the interim, I am drawing and painting every night. And the fact that there\u2019s an audience for it is quite a tickle. So of course I\u2019ll make it available. You bet. I just didn\u2019t see it coming. [Laughs] But like my sister says, I seem to miss the big stuff."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/arts/design/eastward-ho-even-art-is-leaving-for-the-hamptons.html", "title": "Eastward, Ho! Even Art Is Leaving for the Hamptons", "summary": "With vacation homes becoming full-time residences because of the coronavirus pandemic, New York galleries are opening outposts to be near collectors.", "authors": "By Ted Loos", "text": "EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. \u2014 The art collectors were finally coming out of hiding here recently, albeit quietly and tentatively. The artists were, too.The lure? All of a sudden, they have a lot more gallery options lining the immaculate streets of this famously upscale summer town, a seemingly unexpected development in the middle of a pandemic.Since the beginning of June, five major art galleries have opened here: Pace, Skarstedt, Van de Weghe, Michael Werner and Sotheby\u2019s, all arms of New York art powerhouses.And more are on the way soon, in Montauk (Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann\u2019s new venture, South Etna Montauk) and Southampton (Hauser & Wirth).\u201cSelfishly, I\u2019m totally into it,\u201d the artist Rashid Johnson, a Bridgehampton resident, said of the new spaces. \u201cI miss seeing good art.\u201d Mr. Johnson, like every civic-minded person I met, was wearing a mask.New York\u2019s top dealers, artists and collectors have long vacationed here. But now that they have been living here during the pandemic, some gallerists are for the first time seeing the Hamptons as \u201csomething more than a playground,\u201d the artist Clifford Ross, a longtime area denizen, said.I drove out for the day to check out the newly burgeoning scene. When I stopped by Rental Gallery, on Newtown Lane, which has been open for three years, I ran into Mr. Johnson, a close friend of Rental\u2019s owner, Joel Mesler, his neighbor in Bridgehampton. In the front of the gallery, part of a July group show called \u201cFriend of Ours,\u201d hangs an untitled, blood-red drawing of Mr. Johnson\u2019s born of pandemic anxiety.ImagePer Skarstedt, right, in the new Skarstedt East Hampton gallery space, which features, from left, Willem de Kooning\u2019s \u201cUntitled VII\u2019\u2019 (1986); Richard Prince\u2019s \u201c3 Jokes Painted To Death or 3 Jokes Really Painted\u2019\u2019 (1987); and Eric Fischl\u2019s painting, \u201cLike Explaining the End of the World to a Dog\u2019\u2019 (2020).Credit...The Willem de Kooning Foundation/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Eric Fischl/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Karsten Moran for The New York TimesMr. Johnson wasn\u2019t thrilled with the framing (too thick, he said), and as we were talking, he was recognized by two collectors, Erica Seidel and Tom Deighton, who are engaged.\u201cWe own one of your pieces,\u201d Mr. Deighton, a real estate developer, said to Mr. Johnson, referring to a mixed media work.ImageRashid Johnson\u2019s oil on cotton rag work \u201cUntitled Anxious Red Drawing\u201d (2020) hangs near the entrance to Rental Gallery.\u00a0Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesMr. Deighton seemed energized to run into an artist whose work he collects. \u201cA big part of what we do is not investing in art, but getting to know the artists and riding the wave with them,\u201d he said. A wave seemed like a good seaside metaphor for the sudden cresting of galleries here.Mr. Deighton and Ms. Seidel had just been to Pace\u2019s new branch, which had opened that very day, to see the current show, of works by Yoshitomo Nara, another artist they admire.To them, more gallery options were an unalloyed good, though Mr. Deighton added that he hoped they would give a spotlight to emerging artists and not just famous names.Traffic was getting bad as the Fourth of July approached, but I braved Montauk Highway to visit veteran collector Leonard Riggio, the founder of Barnes & Noble, who keeps a museum-worthy trove of outdoor sculptures at his estate, starting with a massive Richard Serra work on his front lawn.Given that outdoor chats are preferred these days, we went out to his back patio and sat under an umbrella as it started to drizzle. He noted that though his collecting has slowed a bit, he was still buying, and he had unsuccessfully bid on a Donald Judd work the week before in a Sotheby\u2019s sale.\u201cYou could say they\u2019re following one another,\u201d said Mr. Riggio of the eastward gallery movement. \u201cBut perhaps better to say they have common wisdom.\u201dThe development is a \u201cbig benefit\u201d for him and his fellow collectors, said Mr. Riggio, a longtime friend and client of the Glimcher family, the owners of Pace. (He said he planned to check out the new branch soon.)ImagePace, which has opened up an outpost in East Hampton, is exhibiting works by Yoshitomo Nara, and, at left, a work by James Turrell.\u00a0Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesI stopped by Pace \u2014 where only 10 people are allowed in the gallery at a time and masks are required \u2014 to talk to Marc Glimcher, who was seated in the V.I.P. area at the back of his new space, which used to be Vered Gallery. Behind him was an Agnes Martin painting, and in front of him was a glowing James Turrell work. There was a small Alexander Calder sculpture in a crate, too.Mr. Glimcher had Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in March and has since recovered. \u201cThis gallery came out of our being sick,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said, noting that his wife, Fairfax Dorn, who also had Covid-19, told him, \u201cWhen we get better, we should open out here.\u201d East Hampton is now the seventh city in which Pace has a branch.Online exhibitions don\u2019t quite cut it, Mr. Glimcher said, and being surrounded by affluent collectors in the Hamptons is helpful for a gallery in that it nurtures relationships.\u201cOur fuel comes from people being in front of art,\u201d he said.Mr. Glimcher\u2019s father, the Pace founder Arne Glimcher, has been coming to the area since the 1970s. \u201cThe big change is that the spaces out here weren\u2019t run by the big New York galleries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was more local.\u201d And that closer-to-home focus included the artists that were shown. He added: \u201cComing to East Hampton was not about doing business. It was to get away from the gallery. It\u2019s ironic that we have a gallery now.\u201dHe chuckled, adding, \u201cBut the collectors are here, and the work has to be seen.\u2019Another veteran, Helen A. Harrison, the director of Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center here, said the international vibe of the new entries was \u201cunusual\u201d for the area; the only comparison she could think of was before her time, the legendary 1957-60 Signa Gallery, a pioneering showcase for modern art, founded by the collector and artist Alfonso Ossorio with John Little and Elizabeth Parker, two other artists who had settled in East Hampton. It featured Abstract Expressionist masters like Robert Motherwell and Jackson Pollock but faded with the coming of Pop Art.And incursions from Manhattan have not always gelled. Ms. Harrison recalled that in 1981, a high-profile collaboration from dealers Leo Castelli, Marian Goodman and Holly Solomon was launched in East Hampton to great fanfare.\u201cIt failed,\u201d Ms. Harrison said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t open their wallets. They were showing the same people as in Manhattan, but people went back there to do the buying.\u201dImageAmalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann in front of their new exhibition space South Etna Montauk, opening July 16. The sign was painted by Julian Schnabel.Credit...via South Etna MontaukFailure is relative, of course \u2014 at the high-flying level of Castelli, the Glimchers and others, an extra gallery can be a pleasant experiment that doesn\u2019t make or break their business.Pace\u2019s lease is only until October, but other dealers in the new crowd have been more ready to commit for the long haul.Both Christophe Van de Weghe and Per Skarstedt \u2014 whose galleries, along with a Sotheby\u2019s space offering art, jewelry and watches, are all lined up near each other along Newtown Lane \u2014 have signed three-year leases.Mr. Skarstedt, who has been living nearby for four months, said opening a branch was \u201cdefinitely a pandemic decision.\u201dHe added: \u201cA lot of our clients moved out here too. And most people will stay till Labor Day or longer.\u201dI checked out the blue-chip art he had on display, which now includes a Willem de Kooning painting and works by Eric Fischl, Jeff Koons, Sue Williams and Christopher Wool.Mr. Skarstedt noted that locals were just becoming aware of the gallery\u2019s presence. \u201cWe\u2019re averaging 20 people a day, more on the weekend,\u201d he said.He said the visitors had mostly complied with pandemic safety, too, with a notable exception. \u201cOnly one guy came in without a mask,\u201d Mr. Skarstedt said. \u201cAnd he was 85.\u201dImageVarnette Honeywood\u2019s \u201cFamily Time\u201d (1984) in the window at Eric Firestone Gallery in East Hampton.

And the newcomers will figure that out.\u201dMr. Firestone also has a gallery in Manhattan, and said he specializes in \u201cpostwar American artists, with strong emphasis on people who were missed or slighted, like Joe Overstreet and Mimi Gross.\u201d He currently is showing work in East Hampton by the African-American painter Varnette Patricia Honeywood (1950-2010), whose works celebrating Black life were included in the set decoration for \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201dWhat of the new competition for collector eyes and pocketbooks? Mr. Mesler of Rental Gallery said he welcomed the big gallery branches, given that all the dealers have different specialties. \u201cThe water\u2019s warm,\u201d he said, by way of invitation, adding, \u201cI\u2019m shocked it took a pandemic to get them to do this.\u201dRestlessness was the driver for Gordon VeneKlasen, the co-owner of Michael Werner Gallery, who has a house in Springs.ImageFrancis Picabia\u2019s \u201cMonstre (V\u00e9nus et Adonis)\u201d (ca. 1924-1927), oil on wood, Michael Werner Gallery in East Hampton.\u00a0Credit...Francis Picabia/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris; via Michael Werner Gallery, New York\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Mr. VeneKlasen said. \u201cI need to see art.

He was 30.The Atlanta Police Department said that officers had initially responded to a single-vehicle accident on I-285, west of downtown, around 11:30 p.m. and discovered the driver deceased, with gunshot wounds.\u201cAt this time, investigators believe the victim was the intended target of the gunfire and they are working to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting,\u201d the police said in a statement.The Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office confirmed on Sunday that Mr. Johnson had been killed. The shooting came amid a rash of gun violence in Atlanta in recent weeks, following a turbulent period of protests against the police killings of Rayshard Brooks there and George Floyd in Minneapolis. \u201cIt has to stop,\u201d Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said last week.Marlo, or Lil Marlo, who was also known locally as Young Rudy or Rude, turned to music relatively late in life, hoping to escape what he referred to as \u201cthe streets\u201d \u2014 a world of guns and drug-dealing that had surrounded him as he was raised in some of Atlanta\u2019s most neglected neighborhoods.In 2017, he signed to Quality Control Music, the homegrown label that had minted stars like Migos and Lil Yachty, alongside his friend and collaborator Lil Baby, who went on to become one of hip-hop\u2019s biggest new stars.\u201cTwo words,\u201d Pierre Thomas, the Quality Control executive, said at the time of the pair: \u201cReal Atlanta.\u201dMarlo went on to release five mixtapes with the label, including his debut, \u201c2 the Hard Way,\u201d with Lil Baby, followed by \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201c9th Ward God,\u201d \u201cThe Real 1\u201d and \u201c1st and 3rd,\u201d from this year, which featured appearances by Future, Young Thug and Gucci Mane. Admittedly not a natural M.C., Marlo got by on the authority of his hard-boiled and hyperlocal street tales, delivering boasts, threats and regrets in a distinct, wheezing squeal that he was still developing.Though not a presence on the Billboard charts, he represented a distinct strain of cult-favorite regional rapper and connector, especially in Atlanta, commanding respect from his more established peers as he inched toward a breakthrough.\u201cI ain\u2019t tripping,\u201d Marlo said of his gradual rise toward the mainstream. \u201cI had to be new to the block before. So it just is what it is.\u201d As his partner Lil Baby racked up industry accolades, Marlo told his fellow rapper, \u201cNo matter what I\u2019m doing, you keep going.\u201dImageLoso Loaded, left, and Marlo during a video shoot in Atlanta in 2017.Credit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York TimesRudolph Simmons Johnson was born on May 1, 1990, and raised in Bowen Homes, one of Atlanta\u2019s most notorious and crime-ridden housing projects, which was demolished in 2009 after a string of killings.\u201cI know how to survive in the jungle,\u201d said Marlo, who called his Bankhead neighborhood and the Bowen projects the \u201chome of the murderers and them drug dealers,\u201d and whose music told of witnessing violence and crack sales from a young age.Mr. Thomas, who has worked to convince his Quality Control artists that music is a safer path, said in a 2017 interview, \u201cAll of us come from the same background \u2014 I know the lifestyle,\u201d adding, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like trying to get out the hood, trying not to make the same mistakes and putting yourself in the position to go back to prison.\u201d Marlo called Mr. Thomas \u201ca real battery pack in me,\u201d an inspiration to try to choose the studio over the street.\u201cSo much potential that the world didn\u2019t get a chance to see,\u201d Mr. Thomas wrote Sunday on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for me to say RIP.\u201dMarlo is survived by his mother, Santresa Maxey; his cousin, Denise Hill-Love, who helped raise him; and his two sons, R.J. and Marlo Jr.Lil Yachty said in an Instagram post announcing Marlo\u2019s death that the two rappers had been recording on Friday night. \u201cWe just did a song [at] 4 this morning smh rip brother,\u201d he wrote.Jacoby Hudson, a longtime friend and Atlanta defense lawyer, said in an interview that Marlo had just left a Bankhead block party late Saturday when he was killed.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, because I told Rudy it would end like this if he didn\u2019t change the people he was around,\u201d Mr. Hudson said in a phone interview. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let the music save him.

The collages, often bubble gum pink, are powered by a painful ambivalence toward conventional notions of sex and femininity, as well as political rage. Ms. Lucas prides herself on working without glue, instead pinning, tying, or sewing the collages together, or embedding their constituent parts in clay.I first met Ms. Lucas about six years ago, tagging along with a gallerist on a studio visit, and since then, I\u2019ve followed her work on Facebook and Instagram, as well as reviewing her 2017 show at JTT. Knowing that she lived alone, I got in touch to ask how she was faring in the pandemic. She told me she had lost her mother at the end of April \u2014 but was also feeling newly inspired.ImageMs. Lucas in her home, where she keeps her studio.Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesWe spoke by Zoom. These are edited excerpts from our conversation.Which came first for you \u2014 collecting tchotchkes, or making art?First came saving pretty things in a box, and then came cutting them up and making my first collages when I was 21, 22. I saved paper palettes \u2014 I had done watercolors and I loved how the paper looked with the splotches of watercolor. I had candy wrappers. I loved chocolate and I would save the beautiful wrapper. And my first collages, I called them specimens, my specimens, were glued.So you were already doing watercolors?Yes, I did an independent study in the Wellesley greenhouses painting flowers with watercolor. And I graduated, and continued watercolor, but moved to collage because of my pretty things in a little box.Weekly visits to Chinatown discount stores were an important part of your creative practice. How well were you stocked when the stores all closed?In my back room there are probably 20 to 30 bags and boxes of things I\u2019ve purchased over the last 41 years. So I was left with my 20 to 30 bags.Image\u201cUntitled\u201d (2020).Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesImage\u201cUntitled\u201d (2020).Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesDid you approach them differently once you knew they would be all you had?When I went in my back room and chose a bag, it was almost like I was at the seashore looking for shells. I would take a bag, sit on my couch, and lovingly go through it, an item at a time, looking for things that were interesting.I had new courage to dismantle and cut up things I overvalued. The store-bought object is not meant to be cut up and dismantled. It\u2019s highly valued in our culture. Especially by women. We take care of things, we wash things, we store them. Especially feminine and pretty things. A few people I know said, You really cut that doll up? My mother said that to me. She\u2019s appalled that I did this, actually. My mother is someone that deeply and truly valued what she purchased in stores. I mean, really. That was her hobby, shopping, high-end shopping. She didn\u2019t shop at 99 cent stores. She shopped at Saks Fifth Avenue. She had a whole cedar closet for her clothes. She had a laundress who laundered her clothes. They were impeccable. And here I am with my scissors snipping things up, and it made her very upset. Probably why I did it!What happened to her?She died of the virus. She was 93 and in assisted living in Riverside, Calif. She never had any terrible respiratory problem. She took a bad fall, basically, and we think she took the fall because of the virus. Everyone was tested, my mother was tested \u2014 she had the virus.Image\u201cI think the power, the pleasure, and my feeling of mastery come when I\u2019ve destroyed these feminine things and I\u2019ve repurposed them in my own way,\u201d Ms. Lucas said.Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesWould you say that cutting up dolls and toys is a way for you to take possession of the violence that pop-culture does to women?Exactly. You know, this is a little tool for sewing [pointing to a needle], but made useless \u2014 it\u2019s too small. But I feel like, by poking and spearing, I\u2019m using it in a clever and wonderful way that emotionally is very rewarding to me. It\u2019s tiny and strange and mildly violent to pierce things. Especially things that are so feminine, so loaded with prettiness.And then, in the process of reassembling the pieces, is there a kind of psychological healing?I think you\u2019re right. I think the power, the pleasure, and my feeling of mastery come when I\u2019ve destroyed these feminine things and I\u2019ve repurposed them in my own way. To make something new that\u2019s mine, that\u2019s whole. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the essence of me being an artist.What you do with dolls also makes me think of the Polish-Jewish sculptor Alina Szapocznikow, who survived the Nazis only to be felled by breast cancer. How does being Jewish play into your work?I\u2019m one of four children, and when we were very young, my mother started telling us all about the Holocaust, in too much detail, gruesome detail. And I have a vivid memory of thinking, I don\u2019t want to hear this. We have a morbid streak in my family. My sister and brother have it, too. They love telling tales that are incredibly gruesome. They admit it. I\u2019m not sure why. The underside of life is something they like to share. Looking back, now that I\u2019m grown up and getting older and older \u2014 I wish my mother had tried to protect me. I wouldn\u2019t have minded hearing about the Holocaust when I was older.ImageAt left, \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Daughter\u201d (2011); above right, \u201cUntitled,\u201d from the 1980s, and below it, \u201cUntitled\u201d (2017).Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesShe talked to you about it when you were how old?Oh, way too young. Way too young.What about being a woman? How were you taught to be a woman?I don\u2019t know about women of your generation, but the easiest way for me to be in life is to show vulnerability, to show weakness, and to ask for help, and to lean up, say I need something \u2014 that\u2019s like breathing for me. I can\u2019t comprehend how men can\u2019t do that.To me, your work has always seemed full of torment, but you talk so positively about the process of making it. How do you reconcile difficult subject matter with the pleasure of making art \u2014 and what are you excited about going forward?I\u2019m yearning to make a small, beautiful universe that\u2019s filled with the reality of the times \u2014 which is that things are dismembered and cut up. Because what\u2019s going on outside is so scary and dark and worrisome, my little universe will reflect all that. But because I\u2019m healthy and alive and working, I can [also] tell a story where there\u2019s some beauty, and some sensuality. The whole endeavor is positive, let\u2019s put it that way. It makes me feel alive, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel smart. It makes me feel, this is me."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/arts/music/pop-smoke-hamilton-billboard-chart.html", "title": "Pop Smoke and \u2018Hamilton\u2019 Shake Up the Billboard Chart", "summary": "The posthumous debut album by the Brooklyn rapper landed at No. 1, becoming one of the biggest releases of a slow summer in music.", "authors": "By Joe Coscarelli", "text": "The posthumous debut album by the Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke, who was shot and killed in February, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week, arriving as one of the biggest releases of a slow summer in the music business, one of countless industries greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cShoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,\u201d Pop Smoke\u2019s third career release following two mixtapes, had the largest opening week since Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cChromatica\u201d in early June, earning the equivalent of 251,000 albums sold, factoring in both streaming and traditional sales.

Has Pew fallen to earth, like the extraterrestrial in the David Bowie movie? Has Pew suffered a kick from a horse? Has Pew, like Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Billy Pilgrim, come unstuck in time?The action takes place in an unnamed town in the American South. Pew is taken in by Hilda and Steven and their children; they\u2019re a God-fearing Christian family that hopes to get Pew \u201cappropriate\u201d treatment. They send Pew to counselors, thinking they might have a trauma victim on their hands.[ This book is one of our most anticipated titles of July. See the full list. ]They hire doctors to examine Pew. Everyone wants to know what\u2019s between those legs. It\u2019s the tabloid talk of the town, the way Brooke Shields\u2019s virginity was in the 1980s. Pew rebuffs medical explorations. The family puts Pew in an attic room. Sometimes they lock the door.The town is looking forward to the Forgiveness Festival, around which there is excitement and dread. This novel owes a debt to Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s short story \u201cThe Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\u201d (the novel\u2019s epigraph comes from it), which features a similar festival. The reader will also summon Shirley Jackson\u2019s short story \u201cThe Lottery\u201d to mind, and the reader is not entirely wrong to do so.Pew has the ability to peer, if only slightly, into other people\u2019s souls. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it is I can sometimes see all these things in people \u2014 see these silent things in people \u2014 and though it has been helpful, I think, at times, so often it feels like an affliction.\u201dPew is a blank pawn inserted into the gender wars. Modern-day Phyllis Schlaflys say things to her like: \u201cNow, you might know that some people these days like to think a person gets to decide whether they are a boy or a girl, but we believe, our church believes and Jesus believed that God decides if you\u2019re a boy or a girl.\u201dThis is a novel that takes itself very seriously. The reader who has kept pace with Lacey\u2019s fiction will be willing, mostly, to take it seriously, too. Born in Mississippi, the author lives in Chicago. She is the author of two good previous novels, \u201cNobody Is Ever Missing\u201d and (better) \u201cThe Answers,\u201d and a book of plangent short stories, \u201cCertain American States.\u201dWhat works in this novel is its Kafkaesque sense, through Pew, of free-floating anxiety and mortification of a sort that is impossible to define and thus impossible to soothe. Pew will not be characterized, interpreted, diagnosed or annotated. She seems to drift, like the planchette on a Ouija board.Pew\u2019s muteness draws out other people\u2019s stories, in the manner of the fiction of Rachel Cusk, among others. Some of these are confessional and quite dark, yet few resonate.Lacey has a mastery of the lives and lingo of the Have a Nice Day crowd, the kind of people whose defensive optimism keeps them from learning about anyone. She stacks the deck so heavily against these hair-sprayed grotesques that they\u2019re brittle, however; they crack like dry spaghetti.This novel walks a high wire between pretentiousness and a kind of cool, disembodied unease. For me, it fell too often into the goo pit. \u201cSometimes I think I might be writing a letter to sleep\u201d is a not-atypical comment by Pew. Hilda\u2019s tightly held hair, Pew says, \u201cmade me feel the pressure and presence of every person who had never been born.\u201dPew feels as if Pew is lying perpetually in a canoe, able only to see the sky above. The reader may feel stuck looking in the other direction, as if his or her face has been inserted into the equivalent of one of those holes at the ends of massage tables, where all one can see is floor tile and dust mites.Pew is aloof, recessive. People project onto Pew. Some think Pew is an archangel. Others think, with Pew\u2019s brown skin, that Pew should be a busboy or a dish washer. Pew would prefer not to be called anything; to name, in this novel, is to take colonial possession. Names are sorting errors.Will the town come for Pew with pitchforks and torches? Will this novel find wind and hoist sail? Lacey is such a talented writer that she casts a certain spell, even when that spell is distant and difficult to tune in."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/books/action-park-dangerous-amusement-park-andy-mulvihill-interview.html", "title": "\u2018Action Park\u2019 Looks Back in Amusement and Terror", "summary": "", "authors": "By John Williams", "text": "In 1980, when he was 16 years old, Andy Mulvihill stood at the top of a water slide called Cannonball Loop at Action Park, the beloved and notorious New Jersey amusement park founded in 1978 by his father, Gene Mulvihill. The Cannonball Loop included an \u201cimprobable\u201d 360-degree vertical turn near the finish. Andy had been enlisted as the first living creature to test the safety of the experience. Previously, \u201csomeone had tied off the ankles and sleeves of an old janitorial jumpsuit, stuffed it with sand and fabricated a head out of a plastic grocery bag,\u201d Mulvihill writes in his new book, \u201cAction Park: Fast Times, Wild Rides, and the Untold Story of America\u2019s Most Dangerous Amusement Park.\u201d \u201cThe makeshift dummy cleared the loop but emerged decapitated.\u201dAs Mulvihill writes a little later on, \u201can illusion of risk\u201d is the \u201cbackbone\u201d of amusement parks, but at Action Park, which closed in 1996, \u201crisk has never been an illusion. If something looks dangerous, that\u2019s because it is.\u201d Many injuries and even several deaths earned the place nicknames over the years, like Class Action Park and Traction Park. Below, Mulvihill talks about people chased by snakes, his fearless father and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time. So many stories are retold between family and friends, and they\u2019re so good it just seemed it would be a shame to keep them to ourselves. Many people have an Action Park story or two, but I have hundreds. There are many stories out there, and some are exaggerated or just plain untrue. I wanted to put the real story in writing, from someone who lived through it.Everyone asks: How did this place exist? What motivated Gene to pursue it? The park has become this internet legend, and it\u2019s fun to share wipeout stories, but there was a much larger story about ambition and this little guy \u2014 little relative to the corporate theme park business \u2014 carving out a place for himself by being bold, brash and different. Gene building it is one thing; that it attracted millions of people despite having a reputation for being hazardous says something about our culture, and I wanted to explore that.About two and a half years ago, what prompted me was that I saw Johnny Knoxville was going to do something inspired by Action Park, and I thought: \u201cAndy, come on. Just do it.\u201dImageAndy Mulvihill, whose book, \u201cAction Park,\u201d recalls his time growing up at the New Jersey amusement park.Credit...Michael J. LeBrecht IIWhat\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I knew my father was a risk taker, but I never really understood the size of the risks, and the sheer tenacity and confidence he possessed to take them on. He was fearless.I look back on the incredible number of crazy ride ideas and the inventors he\u2019d back to develop those ideas, and it just blows you away. Some of them never worked out, but the ones that did were incredible. He didn\u2019t rely on market research or long-term planning; he acted on gut instincts. Contrast it with the bigger parks and all of their exhaustive analysis.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I wanted to tell the Gene Mulvihill story, and an editor at Penguin, Sam Raim, convinced me to tell it from my perspective as a young person growing up at Action Park. I really just had a bunch of stories to tell. It was my co-author and wordsmith, Jake Rossen, who wove the individual stories into a tale, into the bigger story. I\u2019m not a writer, so I really leaned on other people. My writer\u2019s a younger guy, my editor\u2019s younger, and they were telling me what to do. I\u2019ve been around a while, but you have to size people up and decide if you should listen to them, and I can\u2019t tell you what great guidance I got from the people at Penguin.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?My father. He was a creative genius and a driven entrepreneur. It\u2019s one thing to have dreams and ideas, it\u2019s another to execute them. He never took no for an answer \u2014 whether from an investor, regulator, inspector or government official.He invented the water park and participation rides where you controlled the action, where you were in control of your own destiny. He was really the precursor to extreme sports and the X Games, only he did it at an amusement park. He wanted to show people something they\u2019d never seen before. He never settled for mediocrity \u2014 that was boring. If you\u2019re going to do something, go all out. Shoot for greatness. Do not check the box, blow it up. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve led my life embracing that premise.Persuade someone to read \u201cAction Park\u201d in 50 words or less.My father built a place where you could do whatever you wanted. There was a joy and freedom in that, even when people were getting enemas from the water slides or chased by snakes in a human maze.

She has no problem calling Donald Trump a narcissist, and she also identifies additional signs of antisocial personality disorder (the vaingloriousness), dependent personality disorder (the neediness) and a substance-induced sleep disorder (the dozen daily Diet Cokes). When she writes in her prologue that \u201cDonald has been institutionalized for most of his adult life,\u201d she isn\u2019t referring to anything so salubrious as mental health treatment. \u201cInstitutionalization\u201d here refers to the gilded cosseting provided by the family name and fortune that ensured Donald would never have to survive by his own wits in the real world.But will the real world survive Donald Trump? Mary says that American democracy will not if he gets a second term. The story she describes in \u201cToo Much and Never Enough\u201d is presented as a cautionary tale. Donald, she says, can\u2019t help recreating a familial psychodrama that destroyed everyone it touched. She recalls waking up at 5 a.m. the morning after the 2016 election: \u201cIt felt as though 62,979,636 voters had chosen to turn this country into a macro version of my malignantly dysfunctional family.\u201dThat dysfunction is abundantly chronicled in this book, as Mary describes how the five Trump children of her father\u2019s generation all struggled to make do in a household where their mother\u2019s chronic health problems left them at the mercy of a patriarch who was both uncaring and controlling. The oldest, Maryanne, was the uptight good girl; Freddy was the laid-back rebel; Elizabeth was the unassuming middle child; Rob was the baby, quiet and eager to please. And Donald, the second-youngest, was Donald: ingratiating to his father, disobedient to his mother and bullying to his younger brother, stealing little Rob\u2019s favorite toy trucks and goading him into kicking a hole in the bathroom door.ImageThe sanitized version of the family myth is that Fred Trump valorized the importance of hard work, but Mary says this simply isn\u2019t true. Fred\u2019s real estate business depended on political connections and government largess; what he taught the Trump children to revere was not so much effort as dominance. \u201cThe person with the power (no matter how arbitrarily that power was conferred or attained) got to decide what was right and wrong,\u201d Mary writes. The world was a zero-sum death match between winners and losers. Mary explains how a child would experience such life lessons as confusing, terrifying and stultifying. Her father, the eldest son, tried to resist, becoming a commercial pilot for a time before despair and alcoholism crushed his career, his marriage and his health; he died of a heart attack at 42, when Mary was a teenager.Donald, though \u2014 he thrived in the world that his father created, even if, as Mary argues, his personality was ultimately deformed by the experience. The psychologist in her is sympathetic. She says her uncle has the emotional maturity of a 3-year-old and has \u201csuffered mightily,\u201d burdened by what she calls an insatiable \u201cblack hole of need.\u201d He was trained to hunger endlessly for daddy\u2019s approval; it\u2019s just that now, as president of the United States, she says, the figures who remind him of home are Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.Of course, her book is unlikely to change anybody\u2019s mind. One imagines that a number of the president\u2019s supporters may not even consider his upbringing to be that disturbing, considering how he himself continuously re-enacts Fred\u2019s grab bag of parenting methods \u2014 the belittling, the \u201ctoxic positivity\u201d of saying everything\u2019s great even as it collapses \u2014 on the national stage. But Mary, who was also a graduate student of comparative literature, knows how to tell a story and choose an anecdote.A section on the gifts that her family received from Donald and his first wife, Ivana, suggests that their feints at generosity were bizarrely cheap and therefore rich with symbolism. Her brother received a handsome leather-bound journal that was two years out of date; Mary received a cellophane-wrapped food basket consisting of crackers and salami and an indentation on the tissue paper where a jar of caviar had been removed. Her mother got a fancy handbag that contained a used Kleenex.Mary recounts the battle over her grandfather Fred Trump\u2019s will, countering her family\u2019s depiction of her as disgruntled and money-grubbing: \u201cWills are about money, but in a family that has only one currency, wills are about love.\u201d But how could it be about love when her book suggests there wasn\u2019t any? It might be more accurate to say that wills are about power, and that the family also traded in humiliation. Just as Donald couldn\u2019t bear being poor, he couldn\u2019t tolerate feeling shame.This is a book that\u2019s been written from pain and is designed to hurt. Recalling her decision to share financial documents with a team of New York Times reporters who would write a 14,000-word article on the Trumps\u2019 tax schemes in 2018, Mary describes feeling so damaged by her grandfather\u2019s cruelty \u201cthat only a grand gesture would set it right.\u201d Forget the psychologist\u2019s vocabulary of childhood attachment and personality disorders; it\u2019s when Mary talks about her need \u201cto take Donald down\u201d that she starts speaking the only language her family truly understands."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/books/review/crime-fiction-jessica-barry-dont-turn-around.html", "title": "Murder, Murder, Everywhere", "summary": "", "authors": "By Marilyn Stasio", "text": "Male authors love to send their male heroes on the road. Any excuse will do, from a gathering of crime clans to a rowdy biker rally. (For my money, \u201c32 Cadillacs,\u201d by Joe Gores, tops the chart on these screwball road-trip crime novels.) Female authors, not so much. Which brings us to DON\u2019T TURN AROUND (HarperCollins, 320 pp., $27.99), a hair-raising entry in this subgenre by the pseudonymous Jessica Barry.Cait Monaghan hits the road out of desperation, trying to extract herself from a nasty run-in with internet trolls. It all started with an essay she wrote called \u201cWORST. DATE. EVER,\u201d about the time she\u2019d been choked during sex. The response to the article rattled her. Besides the expected notes of commiseration from women who had been similarly victimized, there were personal threats so savage they made her fear being physically attacked. \u201cWho were these people and why did they hate her so much?\u201d Cait wonders.Why, indeed? Barry digs deep down into the topic of internet trolling, not savoring the vileness, the way some authors do when writing about serial murderers, but with a sense of awe at the level of depravity she finds on the dark web. To cleanse her own soul, Cait works as a Lyft driver delivering battered women to shelters, volunteers at an abortion clinic called \u201cSisters of Service\u201d and tries to help vulnerable people like Rebecca McRae, who urgently needs to be rescued from Lubbock, Texas, and driven over 300 miles across the state line to Albuquerque. But once they hit the highway the women pick up pursuers without knowing which one of them is being chased, or by whom.To me, the most illuminating aspect of this book is that it\u2019s absolutely humorless. In male versions of the road-trip novel, the guys manage to have a lot of fun between the obligatory car chases, highway shootouts and other daredevil conventions of the formula. From the perspective of women being chased across the country by men with a vicious agenda, the open road looks a whole lot scarier \u2014 and much too scary to joke about.\u2666No good can come of male social clubs whose privileged fellows refer to themselves as \u201cthe Lost Boys.\u201d In THE STONE GIRL (Norton, 460 pp., $27.95), Dirk Wittenborn exposes a precious clique of such \u201cboys\u201d for the sexual predators they are through the story of Evie Quimby, who is assaulted by a creep belonging to a private hunting reserve in the Adirondacks called the Mohawk Club. The members there all marry rich women and then exploit them, \u201cmilking them like a herd of prize dairy cows.\u201dEvie survives the experience and goes on to become an internationally respected art restoration expert \u201cwhose hands were trusted enough to repair statues for the Louvre.\u201d Years later, though, she\u2019s lured back to the historic lodge, and into the orbit of the Lost Boys. Wittenborn writes seductive prose that juxtaposes the rugged glory of the Adirondacks against the ugly undercurrents of humanity.\u2666The year is 1586, the setting is London, and the political situation is dire in S. J. Parris\u2019s latest historical mystery, EXECUTION (Pegasus, 484 pp., $25.95). Elizabeth Tudor sits on the throne. Her cousin, Mary \u2014 to some, the queen of Scotland, dowager queen of France and the rightful queen of England, but to her enemies, \u201cthat conniving Scottish witch\u201d \u2014 languishes in the Tower of London. What a great opportunity for regicide!Giordano Bruno, the Italian philosopher-sleuth in this sumptuous series, goes undercover as a Jesuit priest to thwart the assassination plot before it can bring down the monarchy and throw the nation into anarchy.But first, he must solve the exceptionally cruel murder of a much-loved woman whose abused body is discovered in an abandoned graveyard, \u201ca pit of sluts, criminals and suicides.\u201d The ferocity of that killing is fair warning of what\u2019s ahead: scenes of prison torture (think: \u201cstrappado,\u201d \u201cscold\u2019s bridle\u201d and \u201cthe heretic\u2019s fork\u201d), culminating in a public execution so intense that it might cause one to toss one\u2019s cookies.\u2666Orna, navigating an online dating site, messages Gil because \u201chis profile was unexciting\u201d and his photos \u201cnothing too special.\u201d When they meet for the first time, he puts her at ease by asking: \u201cWhat are we actually doing here?

Mishani puts together, in THREE (Europa, 245 pp., $25), a thoughtful puzzle mystery, translated from the Hebrew without any fuss or feathers by Jessica Cohen. After a slow start, their relationship blossoms \u2014 at least, until Orna starts noticing discrepancies in Gil\u2019s supposedly heartfelt revelations about his personal history. Is he really who he seems to be? For that matter, is she?Mishani has constructed the plot as a psychological thriller, a conventional format in any language, but the story has a lot more to say for itself. To be sure, there are scenes of genuine terror. (How\u2019d you like to be tied up and see someone coming at you wearing rubber gloves?) But there are also surprising plot twists and smart character insights, not to mention some terrific Tel Aviv street scenes."}, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/books/review/modern-mothers-and-daughters-in-three-novels.html", "title": "Modern Mothers and Daughters, in Three Novels", "summary": "", "authors": "By Lynn Steger Strong", "text": "EVERYTHING HERE IS UNDER CONTROLBy Emily Adrian350 pp. Blackstone. $24.99.ImageIt\u2019s the summer of 2016, and Amanda has taken her newborn son and fled her married life in Queens for her hometown of Deerling, Ohio \u2014 a town \u201cdivided into four quadrants: the farmlands, the trailer parks and a residential jumble bisected by train tracks\u201d \u2014 where she reconnects with her estranged best friend, who never left. Carrie is a celebrated tattoo artist and a single black mother (to 13-year-old Nina), quiet and brilliant with babies. Recalling Carrie\u2019s labor at 18, for which she was in attendance, Amanda thinks of how her friend was predictably heroic and also of how she briefly wondered if Carrie might have been exaggerating her pain, for effect. Back then, they were the type of best friends we\u2019ve come to know well in a certain type of fiction: devoted and almost overlapping selves whose bond is not without its precariousness.At first Amanda\u2019s homecoming seems like a reaction to the particular traumas of early motherhood. The women fall into steady, if wary, rhythm with each other, their reunion setting the stage for the unfurling of a long-kept secret that\u2019s made all the more dramatic by the intense and often thrilling complexity of this relationship. Meanwhile, the impending arrival of Amanda\u2019s well-intentioned but inattentive husband, Gabe, threatens to rupture their renewed intimacy; and Nina, a young woman of color in a Midwestern town covered in Trump signs, begins to explore the attractions and inherent dangers of politics.Often, in great fiction, the characters\u2019 responses and interactions can prove more interesting than the plot itself. \u201cEverything Here Is Under Control\u201d \u2014 the Y.A. author\u2019s adult debut \u2014 is filled with compelling characters, but the first half of the novel fails to elevate them over the events they partake in. There is a thinness to the first 100 or so pages that arises from the book\u2019s desire to continue to withhold a Major Secret; as a result, this part feels flatter and less engaging than the second half, which is so full of texture and authentic human ambivalence that it more fully serves the characters that Adrian has so deftly drawn.THE BALLAD OF BIG FEELING By Ari Braverman 165 pp. Melville House. Paper, $17.99.ImageThe unnamed narrator of Braverman\u2019s novel is batty with sensation, physical, sensual, visual \u2014 susceptible to the internal push and pull of wanting both to take care of and to be the one taken care of. At 33, the narrator lives thousands of miles from her mother, \u201can ouroboros of threat and promise\u201d who now \u201chas no health insurance and no credit cards\u201d to pay for her chronic illness, so she depends on \u201cdoctor friends who help her with samples and after-hours clinic visits whenever there is a gap\u201d in her out-of-pocket payments. (Though \u201cthe family money has been gone for a long time,\u201d the narrator notes that her mother \u201cstill has expensive dinnerware in all the cupboards.\u201d)Despite her illness, the mother thinks quite a bit about her body\u2019s heft and shape \u2014 and so does her daughter. Close to the end of the novel, the narrator flies home (where exactly either of them lives is left ambiguous) to help pack up her big house so she can move into a smaller one. The two share a chaste meal and then store-bought cupcakes, an indulgence that brings the narrator to tears.The narrator lives with her lover, and has a good-enough job that she doesn\u2019t mention often. She buys groceries and fetches cigarettes for her neighbor, who is slowly dying. She is muddling through life in much the same way most of us do, which is to say informed by a past she can\u2019t quite make sense of, without models that feel appealing, bumbling but sometimes able to acknowledge, and even be grateful for, small moments of grace. Throughout, Braverman spins images that pull that perfect trick of making the familiar feel fresh and new. The author has a particular gift for rendering theoretical abstractions, not only as thoughts and feelings, but as materialized objects. The idea of death, for instance, \u201cmoves on its mouse feet, on its palmetto wings, around the room,\u201d and at another point \u201cskitters around the room along the floorboards, flits up near the battered crown molding of the ceiling, kept company by the smoke.\u201d If the book lacks a particularly strong engine beyond the power of the language, the reader hardly notices. It\u2019s so exciting, feeling the sharpness of the world through the perspective of this woman. It\u2019s a thrill to see that language can still be made to help us feel the rush of life anew.ARTIFACT By Arlene Heyman273 pp. Bloomsbury. $27.ImageNear the end of this debut novel, Lottie Levinson shares a glass of wine with her teenage stepdaughter as they sit with the young man who is waiting for her eldest daughter to come downstairs for a date. In the bathroom are parts of the experiment Lottie, a biologist, has had to bring home from the lab, since her musician husband got a call for a last-minute gig. The scene ends, perhaps unsurprisingly, with an accident involving Lottie\u2019s chemicals and her youngest son. As she\u2019s being questioned at the hospital, Lottie feels that particular mix of shame and sorrow that comes from being a woman who wants to be a good mom but also more than that.Lottie\u2019s research also opens the novel; though she is \u201cone of the most productive people in her department,\u201d perhaps unsurprisingly given that it is 1984 and she is a woman, she never gets a promotion. Instead, her work is \u201csavagely\u201d critiqued, her grant proposals denied. The word \u201cartifact\u201d is mentioned often early in the novel, as part of a paper Lottie \u2014 who earned her Ph.D. after the failure of her first marriage, to her high school sweetheart \u2014 is submitting to journals for publication. In the context of her research, an \u201cartifact\u201d is a particular result of the preparative or investigative part of a scientific procedure \u2014 i.e., an unnatural one. But of course, artifacts can also be objects of historical or cultural significance. There is something of both definitions in this novel, which offers a broad swath of Lottie\u2019s life: from her 1950s Michigan upbringing to her complex and loving blended family in upstate New York. She is a woman in science, a sometimes-single working mother. She experiences many of the traumas both large and small that go with each. As an adolescent she wonders if there might be something wrong with her, \u201cmore like a boy than a girl, or more like a man than a boy. Maybe there weren\u2019t even that many men like her. Maybe she was a freak.\u201d In context, this sentiment has to do with sex \u2014 something Lottie often delights in, but then is made to feel shameful over. But this feeling of not ever being what the world wants of her will haunt Lottie for the rest of her life. The book\u2019s events are sometimes shockingly violent and sometimes painfully mundane, and in that way it feels, more than anything, like an artifact of so many women\u2019s lives."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review/antkind-charlie-kaufman.html", "title": "In Charlie Kaufman\u2019s Novel, a Comic Hero Is Haunted by a Lost Film", "summary": "", "authors": "By Matthew Specktor", "text": "ANTKINDBy Charlie KaufmanStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: A man writes a novel, a very long novel full of recondite information and pop-cultural jokes, references spanning from Shakespeare to Hegelian philosophy to contemporary TV, and a plot that involves both omnipresent corporate sponsorship and the pursuit of a film of mysterious power, which exists only as a single copy.This too-broad summation could describe \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d as easily as it does Charlie Kaufman\u2019s debut novel, \u201cAntkind\u201d \u2014 but you only have to pierce the veil on \u201cAntkind\u201d to discern radical differences. After a brief preamble about a gelatinous sea monster, written in a faux 19th-century argot, we are hurled into the mind of one B. Rosenberg, a film critic driving through the Florida darkness, on the way from New York City to St. Augustine to research a book on gender and cinema. (\u201cB.\u201d is a man \u2014 or, to use his own iconoclastically devised pronoun, a \u201cthon\u201d \u2014 but sticks to the initial for the sake of gender neutrality.) Pompous, opinionated, self-conscious, self-loathing, B. is an astonishing creation: a volcano of ridiculous opinions and absurd neuroses, a balding, bearded nightmare of a person whose involutions could practically carry a 700-page narrative by themselves because they, and he, are so riotously funny.B. stops for a hamburger at a chain called Slammy\u2019s, worries about his various ailments, worries about his girlfriend \u2014 a former sitcom star who\u2019s currently filming on location \u2014 pulls up at his rented apartment complex, and is summarily disturbed by a neighbor shouting what B. perceives to be an anti-Semitic slur. When B. knocks on that neighbor\u2019s door, he discovers one Ingo Cutbirth, an elderly gentleman who claims to have appeared as an extra in the film B. has come down to research, a 1914 silent called \u201cA Florida Enchantment.\u201dAnyone who\u2019s ever seen a Charlie Kaufman film will recognize the landscape here: a loose-but-faithless representation of \u201creality\u201d that ripples with psychedelic strangeness. The laws of gravity almost \u2014 but don\u2019t quite \u2014 apply. Ingo claims to have been born in 1908 (later, he corrects himself: 1900), and to have nearly finished a film he has been working on for 90 years. Perhaps B. would like to see it? \u201cThis is too good to be true,\u201d B. thinks: \u201cancient, reclusive, likely psychotic African-American filmmaker. Outsider art, undoubtedly.\u201d Believing he has struck the film critic\u2019s mother lode, B. dives in. (\u201cFinally I can pry open the prudish legs of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma.\u201d) The film is a fever dream: a technologically advanced claymation tale of a lone twin named Bud Mudd who teams up in a comedy duo with a partner named Molloy. It is also three months long. When B. emerges from what he believes is a masterpiece, his life is forever changed. He calls his editor in New York, packs the film into a truck. When he stops at Slammy\u2019s for a soda, he glances back at the parking lot to see \u2014 the truck has caught fire! His great discovery is lost.If only this summary did any kind of justice to the ferocious comedic energy of the book\u2019s opening, or prepared one for the imaginative maelstrom to follow. It must be said that, by any standard \u2014 and even for someone who remembers the shock of Kaufman\u2019s work when it was passed around Hollywood as unproduced samizdat in the 1990s \u2014 \u201cAntkind\u201d is an exceptionally strange book. It is also an exceptionally good one, and though one is tempted to reach for the roster of comparably gnostic novels by contemporary (-ish) writers \u2014 not just Wallace, but Pynchon, obviously; John Barth; Joshua Cohen, perhaps \u2014 such comparisons inevitably collapse.ImageThe novel\u2019s \u201cplot\u201d essentially consists of B.\u2019s efforts to reconstruct Ingo\u2019s masterpiece from memory, with the aid of a hypnotist named Barassini. (The nearest contemporary antecedent for \u201cAntkind\u201d is most likely Jonathan Lethem\u2019s underrated 2009 novel \u201cChronic City,\u201d which features a film-critic protagonist suspiciously like B.) As B.\u2019s quest grows increasingly absurd and humiliating (for reasons too detailed to explain here, he takes a job in the Zappos corporate offices; he visits a series of therapists and falls in love with a woman named Tsai, then goes to work in a laundromat to serve her), his immersion in the hypno-world of the film becomes ever more total, until the two worlds blur and it becomes difficult to know where we are exactly.New details emerge and then correct themselves. B. is beset with visions of Mudd and Molloy, and of Ingo\u2019s puppets: not just the ones who appeared onscreen, but the thousands the filmmaker meticulously created to remain off-camera, termed \u201cthe Unseen.\u201d He finds himself stalked by the shadowy and malign corporate presence of Slammy\u2019s, and soon enough by the existence of a doppelg\u00e4nger, a successful version of himself whose book is sold out of every store in the city.The novel\u2019s doublings and redoublings are sometimes confounding (by the time B. encounters a second doppelg\u00e4nger \u2014 having accidentally murdered the first one \u2014 and as Mudd and Molloy are occasionally swapped out for a similar duo named Rooney and Doodle, my head began to spin), its perversions of an already-perverse reality (a \u201cDonald Trunk\u201d \u2014 sic \u2014 appears, both as an individual and as a robot army) so lavish as to verge on the gratuitous, and yet. \u2026I\u2019m hard-pressed to call the book \u201cdifficult,\u201d simply because its portrait of B. is so oddly humane and because its baseline energies are closer to those of a Tex Avery cartoon (or an Abbott and Costello routine) than they are to the dauntingly postmodern tradition of which the book also partakes. B. takes ketamine. He develops a clown fetish. He holds forth, ludicrously, on filmmakers he admires (Godard, Judd Apatow) and ones he doesn\u2019t (his b\u00eate noire, the \u201cturgid, overhyped\u201d Charlie Kaufman). He develops a habit of falling into manholes because \u2014 what sort of comic figure would he be if he didn\u2019t?Even at its most hallucinogenic, \u201cAntkind\u201d remains appealingly earthy. Its real presiding spirit, as signaled by the name of one half of Ingo\u2019s comedic duo, is that other \u201cB.\u201d: Beckett. As Kaufman\u2019s B. collapses into a kind of spiritual invalidity (he winds up convalescing in a \u201cclown hospital\u201d), he resembles not just the earlier Molloy but also Watt, or the narrator of \u201cThe Unnamable\u201d: figures whose hopelessness (haplessness, helplessness) is matched by their radical absurdity. And as he walks through a kind of infernal Manhattan (\u201cNo Werner Herzog faces. No Jonah Hills.\u201d Just roaches, crows and flames), B. is left to wonderWhy is this day different from all the other days of the year? What does it have that other days lack?Compassion. UncertaintyWithin the certainty that we will all burn there lies an uncertainty, because within that certainty there are the unanticipated moments, the collisions, the interactions, the physics of how the smoke will curl, what shape the licks of flame will take, the order of combustion, the moments of grace.A fragment plucked from the book\u2019s molten center, but one that concentrates \u201cAntkind\u201d\u2019s strengths, and its real concerns. In a world that is endlessly reshaping itself in the grips of malign and incomprehensible powers, we are all hapless Punchinellos, like B. And yet it is only through being such that we can find \u2014 as Kaufman\u2019s novel does, too \u2014 anything resembling grace."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/books/review/david-mitchell-utopia-avenue-daniel-mendelsohn-biggest-bluff-poker-maria-konnikova.html", "title": "", "summary": "", "authors": "", "text": "Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music | How to ListenOn the cover of this week\u2019s Book Review, Daniel Mendelsohn writes at length about not just David Mitchell\u2019s new novel, \u201cUtopia Avenue,\u201d but"}, null, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/books/review-character-history-cultural-obsession-marjorie-garber.html", "title": "What Is Your True \u2018Character\u2019?

(\u201cYou must not give power to a man unless, above everything else, he has character,\u201d Nixon declared in a television advertisement for Barry Goldwater\u2019s campaign. \u201cCharacter is the most important qualification the president of the United States can have.\u201d)Garber is a celebrated Shakespearean scholar who has been heralded as \u201cthe queen of American cultural studies\u201d and \u201cone of the most powerful women in the academic world.\u201d She has written widely on gender and sexuality, the academy and criticism. She marries high and low culture, using theory to dilate on the cultural significance of Jell-O, faked orgasms and dog ownership (\u201cIs caninophilia an erotics of dominance?\u201d).\u201cMy work is all about boundaries,\u201d Garber said 20 years ago. \u201cMy hope is to unsettle boundaries.\u201d It\u2019s an approach now so mainstream that it\u2019s become an orthodoxy of its own; it\u2019s difficult to think of a writer today, of any genre, who doesn\u2019t congratulate herself for traducing artificial binaries. But how bitterly Garber was rebuked in the \u201990s, for her interest in zines and Madonna. \u201cShe cares nothing for gravitas,\u201d the critic Frank Kermode sniffed. Her appearance on \u201cGeraldo,\u201d discussing her study of cross-dressing, was a scandal.ImageMarjorie Garber, whose new book is \u201cCharacter: The History of a Cultural Obsession.\u201dCredit...Juliana JohnstonThe through line in her eclectic body of work has been an interest in the proper use of literature, which exists, Garber argues, not as a tool of moral instruction but as \u201ca way of thinking.\u201d To think in a literary way is to privilege the question over the answer, to embrace uncertainty and associative imagination. \u201cI do not propose to diagnose culture as if it were an illness of which we could be cured,\u201d she has maintained, \u201cbut to read culture as if it were structured like a dream.\u201dTo read culture, mind you, not interpret it. To hunt meaning is to squeeze art of its value, subtlety and pleasure. Her new book is the complicated fulfillment of this credo.Garber begins with Aristotle, whose conception of character contrasts with our modern idea of an inward, fixed essence. In his \u201cPoetics,\u201d he emphasized character as \u201cdeliberate moral choice\u201d in language and behavior. This notion of character as a quality that can be cultivated \u2014 even instilled \u2014 can be traced through the rise of the self-help movement of the 19th century and the establishment of the Boy Scouts movement, described by its founder, Robert Baden-Powell, as a \u201ccharacter factory.\u201dGarber is at her most fluent and thorough in this section as she traces Baden-Powell\u2019s fusion of Spartan military training and Arthurian chivalric codes into a method of instruction, in which character became synonymous with an idealized form of \u201cmanliness\u201d expressed in thought, attire, even movement. Baden-Powell compared the \u201cfussy, swaggering little man paddling along with short steps with much arm actions\u201d with \u201cthe smooth-going and silent step of the scout.\u201d Garber draws out how the ideology of empire infused the philosophy of the Boy Scouts \u2014 to tame oneself before taming the world.From this careful, attentive treatment, the book picks up speed. References whiz by, like uprooted trees in a cyclone. There goes the ancient philosopher Theophrastus with his taxonomy of social types; there goes the caricaturist William Hogarth, who believed the face to be \u201cthe index of the mind.\u201d Phrenology, exclusionary college admission policies, Freud, inevitably, with his idea of character as the \u201coutward sign, so to speak, of an inward personality\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s plenty to paddle around in, but do we arrive anywhere?I have a high tolerance for rapid, associative, hunch-based writing, but I began to crave an argument, or at least a more explicit examination of the roots and consequences of character\u2019s evolution. Garber will occasionally sidle up to tracing some point of continuity before parachuting away on the gusts of digression.It\u2019s not merely that Garber valorizes description over analysis; it\u2019s that this method strips ideas of their historical context and function. As a critic, she has written powerfully about how life follows art \u2014 our understanding of character, for example, owes much to the construction of character in fiction and drama (to Shakespeare, in particular). But ideas aren\u2019t merely \u201csuggestive\u201d; they don\u2019t live only in the pages of novels or op-ed columns. They are put to particular uses in the service of particular ends. That the self-help movement in England, with its sense of personal responsibility and the perfectibility of character, overlapped with the Industrial Revolution seems salient, to put it mildly, as well as how conservative ideology has inflected the term \u2014 not that this book bothers much with such details.Take her description of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings and Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony that he sexually assaulted her when they were high school students. Sixty-five women who knew Kavanaugh signed a document in support of his character. Twenty-four hundred law professors submitted a letter arguing that he lacked the temperament to sit on the court. Kavanaugh protested \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d by the Democrats, and President Trump weighed in, praising him as \u201ca man of great character and intellect.\u201d We\u2019re invited only to marvel at the copiousness of the term; Garber abstains from exploring how differently each party privately defines \u201ccharacter,\u201d and why.Her governing ethic is always to pose \u201cliterary questions: questions about the way something means, rather than what it means.\u201d In this instance, it\u2019s not merely a case of bringing the wrong weapons to a fight, but also, perhaps, a fitting capitulation to a word whose vacancy remains its power."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/books/review-crooked-hallelujah-kelli-jo-ford.html", "title": "Cherokee Women Aim for a Better Life in \u2018Crooked Hallelujah\u2019", "summary": "", "authors": "By Dwight Garner", "text": "Cans of Aqua Net.

Her book reads like a series of acoustic songs recorded on a single microphone in a bare room with a carpet. There are times when you might wish for more boldness, but she never puts a wrong foot. This is a writer who carefully husbands her resources. Small scenes begin to glitter.\u201cCrooked Hallelujah\u201d has an elegiac rather than a comic tone. Yet when I combed back through my notes, I realized that so many moments had made me smile. Her narrators walk through life saying things like \u201cI tried to smooth my hair and did my best to pull my shorts from my butt.\u201dThere\u2019s a moment in which Justine, when young, begs to go to Six Flags with her father, who has briefly re-emerged. Her Church Lady mother says to her: \u201cIf you want to ride a roller coaster in your first act as a spiritual adult, so be it.\u201dLater, Reney sees her estranged grandfather in a doughnut shop.

Near the end, in the near future, fires seem to presage increasingly apocalyptic events.But Ford\u2019s novel finds its center of gravity at the intimate human level. Justine and Reney, angels flying too close to the ground, dismiss the clean, managerial men who might give them access to the middle class. They crave the bad boys, and in one scene Reney counts up some of her mother\u2019s lovers.\u201cThere was the one who traveled around sharpening barbers\u2019 razors and scissors and prided himself on keeping the kitchen knives sharp,\u201d Ford writes. \u201cThere was a rodeo clown with the sweet dog and his own bag of makeup.

As Julian Zelizer shows in his briskly entertaining (if politically dispiriting) new book, \u201cBurning Down the House,\u201d an ambitious and impatient Republican from Georgia by the name of Newton Leroy Gingrich long ago figured out that corruption was a useful charge for a young upstart to deploy against establishment politicians \u2014 a way of turning their vaunted experience against them. More political experience meant more connections with powerful constituents, which meant more of a chance that some of those connections smelled bad, or could be made to seem that way.Gingrich\u2019s lasting innovation, Zelizer says, was to turn a rhetorical gambit into an actionable weapon. \u201cBurning Down the House\u201d looks at Gingrich before his lofty Contract With America and his down-and-dirty government shutdown, before he became President Bill Clinton\u2019s archnemesis as a gleefully obstructionist speaker of the House.So much that\u2019s associated with the Republican Party under Trump, Zelizer argues \u2014 the rowdiness, the bare-knuckle name-calling, the white-knuckle clinging to power at all cost \u2014 dates back to Gingrich\u2019s ascent in the late \u201980s. Gingrich went from being a junior member of Congress on the fringes of the minority party to the center of Republican leadership by destroying the long legislative career of Jim Wright, the Democratic speaker of the House. \u201cWe can date precisely the moment when our toxic political environment was born,\u201d Zelizer declares. \u201cSpeaker Wright\u2019s downfall in 1989.\u201dIt\u2019s a statement that sounds a little pat (\u201cprecisely\u201d?), but Zelizer has immersed himself in the political life of Gingrich, who realized early on the boons of spinning a tidy narrative and amping up the drama. Having tried and failed at an academic career as a historian, Gingrich liked to depict his entry into politics as the fulfillment of a higher calling that beckoned to him when he visited the World War I battlefield at Verdun as a teenager. \u201cThis will absorb my life,\u201d he told a biographer, solemnly reflecting on his fateful decision to devote himself to public policy. \u201cIt was the most effective thing I could do to ensure that the U.S. would remain free.\u201dImageJulian Zelizer, whose new book is \u201cBurning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Julian ZelizerBut the demands of actual policymaking were too slow and painstaking to hold a restless Gingrich\u2019s attention for very long. He preferred the thrill of the fight, and fashioned himself into an egghead brawler, reminding everyone that he was a trained historian at one moment and railing against the infernal intellectual elites the next. During one of his tirades, he likened Wright to Mussolini. Gingrich later compared himself to Martin Luther confronting the Diet of Worms.But as any politician knows, even the most grandiose words are just words. What Gingrich figured out was how to turn his animus into actual power by leveraging the institutions at hand. That might sound abstract and technical, but the results turned out to be brutal. Zelizer\u2019s last book, \u201cFault Lines,\u201d which he co-authored with Kevin Kruse, a fellow historian at Princeton, traced the origins of our current political divisions to Watergate and President Nixon\u2019s resignation in 1974; in \u201cBurning Down the House,\u201d Zelizer shows how Gingrich was able to exploit the profound developments since Watergate \u2014 a mistrustful electorate, a generation of reporters hungry for stories that carried a whiff of political malfeasance, a set of well-meaning but manipulable good-government reforms \u2014 to his lasting advantage.Gingrich turned C-SPAN, the relentlessly bland public network that was supposed to make Americans better informed about the nuts and bolts of policymaking, into an unlikely broadcaster of hammy theater. He and his allies would deliver a coordinated set of speeches attacking Democrats before a mostly empty chamber, knowing that C-SPAN\u2019s cameras were rolling, and that anything outrageous would get picked up and amplified by mainstream outlets. Wright, who was House majority leader at the time, was irritated enough by the antics of \u201csilly little Newt Gingrich\u201d that he complained about the \u201cshrill and shameless little demagogue\u201d in his diary.Wright\u2019s dismissiveness was a harbinger of how blindsided he would be when \u201clittle\u201d Gingrich eventually came for him. Wright had entered Congress in the Eisenhower era, long before Watergate, when legislating revolved more around chummy relationships than hard-and-fast rules. The Democrats had also controlled the House since 1954, which was more than enough time for a self-satisfied complacency to set in. After Wright became speaker in 1987, Gingrich dug up clippings about his connections to businessmen in his home state of Texas, including figures in the savings-and-loans industry, and paraded them around to reporters. A fishy book deal for a slender volume of Wright\u2019s speeches and notes became a centerpiece of Gingrich\u2019s charges when he filed a formal ethics complaint against Wright.Never mind that Gingrich had his own fishy book-selling arrangement from a few years before, raising money from Republican donors in an attempt to \u201cforce a best seller,\u201d as Gingrich himself put it. Or that Wright\u2019s behavior was decidedly gray, not the stark black and white that a fulminating Gingrich made it out to be.Gingrich, Zelizer writes, contorted the rules and mechanisms of reform to serve his own ends. After the public learned that Wright\u2019s top adviser was a convicted felon whose brother happened to be married to Wright\u2019s daughter, voters were horrified, and House Democrats began to fear for their own political futures. Wright, a tough and effective arm-twisting legislator who saw the House as a counterweight to President Reagan and his \u201ccruelly deranged\u201d policies, decided to step down, saying that he expected his resignation to serve as a \u201ctotal payment for the anger and hostility we feel toward each other.\u201dZelizer writes about all of this with aplomb, teasing out the ironies and the themes, showing that what made Gingrich exceptional wasn\u2019t so much his talent as his timing. He happened to seize power at a moment when a post-Watergate ecosystem paradoxically selected for politicians like him \u2014 legislatively useless, for the most part, but freakishly talented at political warfare and self-promotion, wielding idealism as a cudgel while never deigning to be idealistic themselves.

Baldwin\u2019s example took on renewed relevance toward the end of the Obama presidency, as soaring hopes collided with an enduring reality of police violence and mass incarceration. Writers found in Baldwin a mix of rigor and freedom: Here was an unsparing diagnostician who nevertheless embraced contradictions.Glaude is more explicit about looking to Baldwin not just for perspective and inspiration but for instruction and guidance: Combining elements of biography, criticism and memoir, \u201cBegin Again\u201d \u201caims to think with Baldwin and to interrogate how an insidious view of race, in the form of Trumpism, continues to frustrate any effort to \u2018achieve our country.\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s a blunt-force thesis statement that made me wonder if Glaude, who has long written about the devastation wreaked by American racism with insight and candor, might be selling himself short: Does he really need Baldwin to help him understand Trumpism, a movement whose bigotry seems less \u201cinsidious\u201d than brazen?But I soon realized that Glaude is up to something bigger than his own summary allowed. Where a number of writers have paid ample tribute to Baldwin\u2019s essays from the late \u201950s and early \u201960s, during the early years of the civil rights movement, Glaude finds energy and even solace in the later nonfiction that charted Baldwin\u2019s disillusionment. (Glaude only glances at the fiction, though he takes his title from a line in Baldwin\u2019s last novel, \u201cJust Above My Head.\u201d) Even if you don\u2019t agree with Glaude\u2019s interpretations, you\u2019ll find yourself productively arguing with them. He parses, he pronounces, he cajoles. He spurs you to revisit Baldwin\u2019s work yourself.The usual critique of Baldwin goes something like this: He pursued his idiosyncratic artistic vision in his early work, but the demands of the historical moment turned him into the political spokesman he never wanted to be. His rolling, winding sentences became harder and harsher. He scolded the white liberals who praised him, and praised the Black Panthers who lampooned him. The critic Hilton Als scathingly depicted this transformation as a surrender: \u201cBy 1968, Baldwin found impersonating a black writer more seductive than being an artist.\u201dImageEddie S.

KhanGlaude\u2019s defense of Baldwin\u2019s trajectory is more cultural than literary. He imputes a political discomfort to critiques like Als\u2019s that isn\u2019t entirely fair, but he writes ardently and protectively. And in his own struggle to work his way through the welter of our present \u2014 what he calls the \u201cafter times,\u201d borrowing Whitman\u2019s phrase for America following the Civil War \u2014 he finds in Baldwin a cold-eyed realism sustained by a stubborn moral purpose.Baldwin recoiled at the label of spokesman, identifying instead as a witness \u2014 someone who testified to what he saw without presuming to speak for anybody else. \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of something, which has nothing to do with you, nothing to do with your career, nothing to do with your ambitions, nothing to do with your loneliness, nothing to do with your despair,\u201d Baldwin told his first biographer, in 1963, recalling what he saw on his trips to the American South. It was his \u201cjob,\u201d he said, \u201cto make it real. To force it on the world\u2019s attention.\u201dNot that the world was always willing to look. In \u201cNo Name in the Street,\u201d a jangly, intermittently brilliant book from 1972 (\u201chis most important work of social criticism,\u201d Glaude writes), Baldwin describes how white liberals couldn\u2019t bring themselves to accept even the most glaring evidence of police brutality. To them, racism and bigotry were a matter of \u201chearts and minds,\u201d not power. They maintained an abiding faith in institutions that insisted \u201cthe police are honorable, and the courts are just,\u201d Baldwin wrote. The fantasy of innocence was both childish and deadly.This kind of liberal na\u00efvet\u00e9 comes shrouded in layers of hypocrisy, while Trumpism strides onto stage clutching a bullhorn and wearing a MAGA hat. Glaude considers Trumpism only \u201cthe latest betrayal,\u201d the revival of something old and ugly in American politics. He repeatedly invokes what he calls Baldwin\u2019s \u201cnuance and complexity,\u201d but in a state of emergency he concedes that a hard-nosed approach to the election is a necessary first step.The idea isn\u2019t to return the country to what it was before President Trump; Glaude wants a wholesale re-envisioning, not a complacent restoration. As Baldwin put it in 1980, before Ronald Reagan won the presidential election, explaining the decision to vote for a disappointing Jimmy Carter: \u201cIt will be a coldly calculated risk, a means of buying time.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/books/review-lehman-trilogy-stefano-massini.html", "title": "The Story of the Lehman Brothers, from Bavaria to Alabama, and From the Heights to the Crash", "summary": "", "authors": "By Dwight Garner", "text": "There was a time when American readers kept pace with new plays, even if they didn\u2019t live in New York or couldn\u2019t afford tickets. Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d published by Viking Press, was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection; Edward Albee\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d made good money in hardcover and paperback for Atheneum.When theaters went dark in March, good plays were left dangling early in their runs. Some will never re-emerge, at least not as audiences knew them. One was the Italian writer Stefano Massini\u2019s \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy,\u201d a broad-backed epic about the rise and fall of Lehman Brothers.Massini began writing \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy\u201d in 2008, shortly after the firm precipitously crumbled, like a cigar ash, amid the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. When I initially saw photographs of the New York production, showing dark-suited men gesturing in a gleaming office cube, I assumed the play was a boiler-room account of that collapse.That\u2019s not it at all. Massini\u2019s play pans across 160 years of the firm\u2019s history, beginning when Hayum (soon to be known as Henry) Lehman moved from Bavaria to Alabama and entered the cotton business. The play\u2019s Italian version ran five hours. Sam Mendes, who directed the London and New York productions, whittled it down to three and a half.Massini\u2019s original text, a novel in verse, has now been issued in English for the first time, in a translation by Richard Dixon. It\u2019s a monster, a 700-page landslide of language with no obvious speaking parts. But it\u2019s apparent right from the start that Massini is the real thing. His writing is smart, electric, light on its feet.At the same time, his book ominously circles the big questions: Were the original three Lehman brothers and their descendants heroes or villains? Did they inject spirit and muscle into the American experiment, or were they simply cowbirds, laying eggs in other birds\u2019 nests? The answers are complicated.Less complicated is the criticism, articulated most exactly by Sarah Churchwell in a New York Review of Books essay, that Massini\u2019s play glosses over the Lehmans\u2019 participation in the slave trade in Alabama. Future productions should have to pinch and zoom in on these realities.Henry emigrates to America. Having arrived, hecan smell the stench of New Yorkall over him:a nauseating mix of fodder, smoke and every kind of mold,such that, to the nostrils at least,this New York so much dreamed aboutseems worse than his father\u2019s cattle shed,over there in Germany, in Rimpar, Bavaria.He moves south, to Alabama, for the sunshine. Bertolt Brecht, another Bavarian, had never been to Alabama when he wrote \u201cAlabama Song\u201d (also known as \u201cMoon of Alabama\u201d) in the 1920s. One wonders what Henry expected. He arrives, as do his two brothers shortly thereafter. They are in constant motion, making sure their materials are the finest and their prices the lowest.ImageStefano MassiniThey perfect, if not invent, the all-American idea of the middleman. They become brokers, buying cotton and selling it elsewhere. Their business expands to coffee, oil and coal, and eventually to electricity, railroads, planes, comic books, Hollywood and computing. They enter banking, and the idea of what they do becomes increasingly abstract.Early on we read:First: when we were in businesspeople gave us moneyand we gave something in exchange.Now that we\u2019re a bankpeople give us money just the samebut we give nothing in exchange.At least not for the moment.

Massini writes:The only difference\u2014since the truth should always be told\u2014lies in the fact that the Goldmansdeal in that particular metalcalled goldand are so proud of itthat they flaunt it in their surname.For this, and only for this,they\u2019re in the second rowof the Temple.The family has a lot of worms to drop, via well-buffed fingernails, into the beaks of their young. They learn to launder reputations through philanthropy. A long-anaesthetized sense of morality emerges among some of the young members of the clan.Lehman Brothers grows more predatory. Massini pauses to examine the language of finance. Where once words like \u201csucceed\u201d and \u201ccompetitor\u201d were used, now the terms are \u201cimpose\u201d and \u201cenemy.\u201d The Lehmans wield their power through discipline, control and punishment. Upon their conquered enemies, they impose Carthaginian terms. Business isn\u2019t business, business is war.There is a savvy and strange digression into the movies of the golden age, many of which Lehman Brothers financed. The European author contends that these movies, and actors like John Wayne, permanently dented American ideas of masculinity.\u201cThe man who kisses? Better if he spits,\u201d Massini writes. \u201cThe man who understands? Better if he snaps.\u201d He adds: \u201cYears and years of good manners / swept away by a dozen movies.\u201dMassini writes language that\u2019s excited about itself, and that nearly always casts a spell. If at a few moments I wished I were reading a short nonfiction history of the firm instead, well, those moments were few.The Lehman brothers were good at what they did.

Roy Cooper of North Carolina refused to guarantee a late-August arena party free of social distancing. Several of the R.N.C. members interviewed are planning to first go to Charlotte, where the party\u2019s delegates will conduct much of their official business, before relocating to Jacksonville for the big party so desired by Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s a risk you have to take,\u201d said Morton Blackwell, 80, an R.N.C. member from Virginia who has attended every party convention since he was the youngest elected delegate backing Barry Goldwater in 1964. \u201cYou take risks every day.

He was raised in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, which he left five years ago, and marijuana was \u201cthis thing that I had never really even thought that I was allowed to do,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd then I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait, I can actually make up my own mind about this.\u2019\u201dFor his first foray, Mr. Emerson, 38, chose strawberry-flavored gummies, which he ordered online and picked up curbside at a dispensary near his home in Portland, Ore. \u201cI\u2019m not super-interested in smoking anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as soon as I decided I wanted to try cannabis, I wanted to try something edible.\u201dAnxious times (say, a global pandemic) call for palliatives, like meditation, exercise or, in some cases, weed. More than a dozen states declared cannabis stores and medical marijuana dispensaries essential businesses, along with pharmacies and grocery stores, as the coronavirus sent millions of Americans home, with or without jobs.Since March, the cannabis industry has seen an influx of new customers: Eaze, an online cannabis retailer, told The Associated Press that first-time purchases of cannabis were up more than 50 percent in early March. And as fear of inhaled products has risen \u2014 spurred partly by studies of \u201cvaping illness\u201d and exacerbated by respiratory risks associated with the coronavirus \u2014 many consumers have opted to enjoy cannabis in edible form.When the Apothecarium, an upscale dispensary with locations in California and Nevada, moved from in-store retail to curbside pickup in March, Cali Manzello, the general manager of its San Francisco flagship, noticed a change in the size of orders.\u201cOne of the first orders that printed out from the pickup machine said 25 packages of this gummy on it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we all kind of giggled. We were like, \u2018Ooh boy, here it goes. It\u2019s starting.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt did not stop,\u201d Ms. Manzello continued. \u201cPeople were ordering, you know, up to the legal limit, which can be up to 80 edibles in some cases.\u201d Ms. Manzello said that the company\u2019s edible sales are up 16 percent, while vape sales have fallen by 19 percent.\u201cEdibles every year have been taking up a bigger slice of the pie,\u201d said Alex Levine, an owner and joint C.E.O. of Green Dragon, a dispensary that operates 15 locations in Colorado. \u201cRight before corona hit, edibles were basically at 20 percent of our sales. That was a huge increase over the past couple of years.\u201dImage\u201cFruit notes\u201d (fancy gummies) from Coda Signatures.Credit...Photo Illustration by Buck Ellison for The New York TimesVince Ning, the founder and C.E.O. of Nabis, a wholesale cannabis distributor in California, said that, as a possible result of \u201chealth-conscious\u201d consumerism, his company has also seen an increase in sales of edibles.\u201cI think cannabis in general is a pretty recession-proof good,\u201d Mr. Ning said. \u201cMuch like alcohol,\u201d whose sales also skyrocketed as people prepared to be holed up at home indefinitely.Chris Beals, the C.E.O. of Weedmaps, an online directory for dispensaries, said that according to company data, overall sales of edibles in March were double those in February. He said it could be a result of increased cannabis consumption among habitual users but also \u201cnew consumers coming in, who were working from home, dealing with the stresses of Covid.\u201dIn the close quarters of quarantine, being stuck with roommates or family for an extended period of time, consumers may not want to smoke or vape. \u201cWhen people are working at home or they\u2019re around children or family, edibles are just more discreet,\u201d Mr. Beals said.Lauren Gockley, a classically trained chocolatier, is the director of edibles at Coda Signature, whose product line includes truffles and \u201cfruit notes\u201d (fancy weed gummies). She said consumers may be turning to edibles during the pandemic for other social reasons, including community.\u201cWith the pandemic, there\u2019s not that same sharing of cannabis the way there used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the phrase \u2018puff, puff, pass,\u2019 and now it\u2019s \u2018puff, puff, don\u2019t pass.\u2019\u201d\u201cPassing around a tin of gummies is going to be much more acceptable than passing around a joint or a vape pen,\u201d she added.In April, Mr. Levine said that Green Dragon saw sales of edibles dip. He chalked that up to customers buying flowers, the smokable part of the plant (commonly called \u201cbud\u201d), which they could use to make their own edibles.\u201cPeople didn\u2019t know how long this was going to last. \u2018Is cannabis going to be unavailable for months?\u2019 So people bought flowers,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cFlower is always the best value. It\u2019s like buying the raw ingredients, if you will. It\u2019s always cheaper to buy the flour and stuff to make cookies than buying the prepared cookies.\u201dTee Franklin, a comic book writer and novelist in New Jersey, makes edibles at home and often uses cannabis oil in her cooking. \u201cOh, baby, I make everything,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single thing you can think of, I have made within reason.\u201dThat includes \u201can entire soul food dinner,\u201d which she cooked for herself and her 80-year-old mother: ribs with homemade cannabis-infused barbecue sauce, mac and cheese made with cannabis butter, and baked beans and collard greens cooked with cannabis sugar.Ms. Franklin, who is in her mid-40s, received a medical marijuana card (another item in high demand these days) in December, after seven years of living with a disability caused by a car accident. It took her a month to save up enough money to make a purchase. When she first tried it, she said, \u201cMy pain in five minutes went from a 9, 10 to a 6, 7. Those five minutes changed my entire life.\u201dMs. Franklin still uses a walker, but she said she can move better and stand for longer because of the relief cannabis provides her. \u201cI\u2019m not as slow,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not the Flash, but I got a little pep in my step, and that\u2019s all from marijuana.\u201d\u201cIt helps with depression, anxiety, stress,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way on God\u2019s green Earth that I would be able to deal with the coronavirus and the protests of George Floyd and just me being a Black woman, period, there\u2019s no way.\u201dMs. Franklin said edibles are the most accessible form of marijuana for many people, but not for everyone.Money can be a major barrier, especially since some 20 million Americans are out of work because of the pandemic. Mr. Levine noted that at one of the Green Dragon storefronts where he was recently working, \u201chalf of the people coming in had no income. I\u2019m sure it was even worse than that.\u201dThe price of edibles can vary based on the state \u2014 and the amount of THC \u2014 but with a package of 10 gummies with 100 milligrams per bag of THC selling for $20 in Colorado and $18 in California, the cost can be prohibitive for some people.Mr. Emerson, in Portland, acknowledged that his own ability to afford and have access to legal cannabis, for recreation, was a privilege. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that a lot of people have been able to do,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of damage has been done particularly to Black communities, the communities of color, because of something like cannabis, which is pretty harmless.\u201dMs. Franklin echoed his words, noting the disproportionate incarceration rates of Black people for marijuana possession.\u201cDispensaries are an essential business,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drug-dealing business that is owned majority by white. But the Black people who were doing the same thing are locked up. The brown folks, same thing, they\u2019re locked up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing about this whole weed business that I am not of fan of,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing. Everything else, I am for it.

He had to have known everyone would be looking, given his previous refusal to don face covering. He had to have known the selection would be studied and parsed. He is nothing if not an expert at branding. And masks are fast becoming a short of shorthand for self-branding: a highly visible and easy-to-read identifier of self for the world. That\u2019s why they keep being talked about as a fashion/political statement (fashion being essentially driven by identity politics, when you come down to it).So, for his visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday, what did he go for?Not a generic white or blue mask, the kind that subsumes the personal to the community.

Not one with the sort of gold \u201cTRUMP\u201d logo famous from so many of his real estate ventures. Not even one that displayed any humor or sports preferences.Rather he chose a simple navy blue covering: a plain rectangle that matched his signature suit as well as the masks worn by the members of the military and Secret Service who flanked him, though his also had a gold presidential seal embossed in a bottom corner.

Now, the experience has narrowed into what is possible through a computer screen.Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins and other universities also announced reopening plans this week in which most classes would be held online. (According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, about 60 percent of colleges and universities are planning to allow all students back in classrooms.)Harvard, which will continue to charge full tuition, has said it will allow students who cannot \u201cprogress academically\u201d at home to return to campus in the fall. But its process for evaluating which students qualify is opaque. The form the school is using to assess requests to return asks students to check various boxes indicating challenges at their home, including whether they have a Windows or Macintosh computer and face food insecurity.It reiterates multiple times that the number of people allowed back on campus will be limited, forcing many students into what they perceive as competition with each other over who has a more difficult life. Students understand that campus life cannot return to normal, and that the coronavirus itself is in no way the fault of universities. But in interviews this week, Ms. Adigwe and more than a dozen of her peers expressed frustration at various aspects of the Harvard reopening plan \u2014 particularly, at the $5,000 \u201croom and board\u201d allowance Harvard will give to every student who is eligible for financial aid and who does not live on campus.In many states, $5,000 spread over a semester is less than what someone would make from working a full-time minimum wage job. And the allowance does not correspond with what Harvard students have paid for room and board. (Last academic year, $17,682 for the full year \u2014 almost $9,000 a semester \u2014 according to the university\u2019s website.)Rachael Dane, a spokeswoman for Harvard College, said that the school acknowledged and accepted students\u2019 frustration.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with students and we are doing that as they engage through the financial aid office,\u201d she said.Abby Lockhart-Calpito, 19, a rising sophomore, whose family has struggled with homelessness for much of her life, said she is worried that $5,000 won\u2019t be enough to cover food and housing needs for the entire semester, especially without the on-campus jobs she had while living in the dorms; work is hard to find in the middle of a pandemic.\u201cI know that a majority of Harvard students have places to call home and comfortable spaces in which to do their work in, but that\u2019s not the case for me and many others,\u201d Ms. Lockhart-Calpito wrote in an email.Hana Kiros, 20, a rising junior, said the $5,000 amount feels arbitrary \u2014 not correlated with the real cost of living for students and their families. \u201cWhat could be a lifeline for students on full financial aid could be pocket change for students that barely make the financial aid cutoff,\u201d she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/style/online-communities-social-media-bans-reddit-youtube-twitch-facebook.html", "title": "Who Gets the Banhammer Now?", "summary": "In a single week, some of the internet\u2019s biggest platforms banned users and groups they had tolerated for years. What changed?", "authors": "By John Herrman", "text": "In a typical year, a good way for a company to handle an announcement it hoped to bury is to schedule it before a nice long holiday weekend. This is one way to interpret the last week of June online, when several internet giants took decisive action against mostly far-right communities and users, many of whom who had been sources of controversy for years.Reddit banned The_Donald, the site\u2019s main hub for Trump supporters, and a source of near-constant complaints from other users and communities about hate speech and harassment. The platform also banned more than 2,000 other groups, most much smaller, as part of a revision of the site\u2019s rules that prohibit \u201ccommunities and people that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability.\u201dYouTube, which hardened its rules around hate speech in 2019, banned a group of popular accounts for, among other things, promoting \u201csupremacist content.\u201dTwitch, the livestreaming site, temporarily banned an account associated with President Trump\u2019s campaign for \u201chateful conduct.\u201dAnd Facebook banned hundreds of accounts, groups and pages associated with the \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement for violating a prohibition against users and organizations \u201cwho proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence.\u201dAnother way to understand these bans is as a calculated response to globe-spanning demonstrations against white supremacy, with which each of these platforms has been accused of being, at minimum, complicit. That the platforms acted in the same week suggests that some were waiting for others to act.The move also suggests a desire to have it both ways: to get credit for the bans, most of which were late and represented small fractions of infringing users or groups, and to enact them when any backlash would have a hard time getting traction online.The bans have been described as a \u201creckoning\u201d for social media companies that have, as The Associated Press put it, \u201cfueled political polarization and hosted an explosion of hate speech\u201d and that are now, public relations calculations aside, \u201cupping their game against bigotry and threats of violence.\u201d\u201cReckoning,\u201d however, is an odd word to describe a situation in which social media companies were finally asserting control after years of either pretending not to have any. It looked, instead, like buying time. But for what?The Rules Sometimes ApplyWhat might real change look like for the social media giants? The week of bans suggests one specific vision. \u201cWhen platforms tout the banning of these big names, it\u2019s an important step in the right direction,\u201d said Becca Lewis, a researcher at Stanford University who studies online extremism. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t address underlying issues and incentives that have led to the flourishing of white supremacist content in general.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/style/tiktok-ban-us-users-influencers-taylor-lorenz.html", "title": "What if the U.S. Bans TikTok?", "summary": "Gen Z and millennial users have found community on the app, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic.

Since the border closed to nonessential travel on March 21, some couples have managed to meet in a border-straddling park, while others have gone months without seeing each other in person and have no idea when they will be able to again.Those who are lucky enough to be on the same side of a border as their loved ones may still be hesitant to socialize like old times.

Maybe Don\u2019t", "summary": "You can keep your family safe and sane by encouraging old-school play, embarking on some D.I.Y. projects and, yes, even embracing boredom.", "authors": "By Alexis Soloski", "text": "A funny thing about summer: It is long. It is also hot. This one comes in the middle of a global pandemic.And even in a changed and changing world, I have reserved some mental energy for panicking about how my kids, husband and I will make it to September without everyone\u2019s brains turning into Haribo gummies. Let me put it this way: On a recent rainy Saturday, we baked banana bread and played games. We made lunch together, built a cardboard lantern and learned about the constellations. It was exhausting. And they still put down two Disney movies. Three months into school closures, my children have watched every show. There are no shows left.And yet, working from home with small children, an ordeal and a privilege, has been de rigueur since agrarianism got going. Parents managed it for thousands of years \u2014 without day care, compulsory schooling or camps. What did children used to do all day? Short answer: They worked and they played, often with minimal adult supervision.Unfortunately, as Steven Mintz, the author of \u201cHuck\u2019s Raft: A History of American Childhood,\u201d told me, \u201cThe pandemic has exaggerated and intensified the worst features of children\u2019s play today: adult intrusion; the decline of physical, outdoor and social play; and mediation by screens.\u201d Ow.So, how do we adults ameliorate that while staying safe, employed and reasonably sane? Here are some ideas.Go Old School. Very Old.In an email, Mintz, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s 1560 painting \u201cChildren\u2019s Games.\u201d A canvas to give social-distancing enforcers nightmares, it shows 100 or so Flemish youths disporting themselves with hoops, stilts, bubbles, marbles, the occasional pig bladder and the wholesome fun of beating one another with a scourge. The Flemish parents are elsewhere, presumably answering emails or cracking open a brown ale.ImageChildren at play in Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s 1560 painting \u201cChildren\u2019s Games.\u201dCredit...Kunsthistorisches MuseumThe painting suggests that a lot of play is social, a difficulty in a pandemic. But it also insists that the desire for play is innate and that children will find ways to amuse themselves, especially if you can supply some rudimentary toys \u2014 kites, cards, blocks, dolls, balls, paper boats and paper airplanes, a garden hose if you have one, a half-filled tub. If they have a safe space to play outside (where the toys are even more analog: sticks, rocks, dirt) and you can work from your phone while they do it, even better.This may also be a good time to get away from the idea that play should be educational or S.T.E.M.-enhancing. \u201cAll play is productive,\u201d Mintz said. \u201cThey will learn something from whatever they do.\u201dEmbrace BoredomStill, children may not want to play on their own or with a sibling, and you may have conference calls or Twitter threads that beckon. Which means they will claim boredom, and more than likely they will whine about it. What should you do? Nothing.Feeling that we ought to keep kids happy and entertained is a comparatively modern mind-set and speaks to certain resources and luxuries. Instead of trying to prevent boredom, maybe welcome it and see what children do. Tom Hodgkinson, author of \u201cThe Idle Parent,\u201d suggested ramping up slowly, with an hour or so of \u201cnothing time\u201d every day. Maybe less, if your children are very young. If they resist, he suggested doubling down on tedium \u2014 reading \u201cParadise Lost\u201d or screening a Tarkovsky film \u2014 so that they end up running into another room and doing something else.\u201cYou could try boring them with your games so they invent something better,\u201d he advised. \u201cBe a really boring mom.\u201dA D.I.Y. Approach to CultureNormally, around this time of year, my desktop and actual desk are littered with notes about outdoor theaters, concerts in the park, and art installations that might hold a child\u2019s attention for 10 whole minutes. Now my calendar looks like new-fallen snow.If you can\u2019t take your kids to cultural events, have your kids bring culture to you. \u201cBe like Louisa May Alcott,\u201d Mintz suggested. The March girls of \u201cLittle Women\u201d don\u2019t spend a ton of time lobbying for more \u201cMy Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\u201d episodes. Instead they make up fantasy plays, write newspapers, craft costumes, stage their own circus, act out stories from Dickens\u2019s \u201cThe Pickwick Papers.\u201d (\u201cThe Pickwick Papers\u201d are not exciting! And still they make do.) Their efforts may be painful, but the 20 minutes your children spend preparing a deeply revisionist \u201cFrozen 2\u201d is 20 minutes you can spend doing something else.Two Words: Free LaborHousework can also become a form of play, and depending on how well or poorly your children do it, may be some help. In the 19th century, Hodgkinson said, \u201cchildren were seen as not necessarily a burden on the household, but a welcome labor force.\u201d Employ them.\u201cThe thing to remember is that kids want to help, so try to get them in the habit of doing some of those things,\u201d Lenore Skenazy, president of Let Grow, a nonprofit promoting childhood independence, said. \u201cA 3-year-old separating laundry is quite possible and also quite fun. Six-year-olds can be making breakfast.\u201d So, yes, children can cook, they can clean. If you can take a few extra minutes to gamify the chore \u2014 Mary Poppins\u2019s \u201cSpoonful of Sugar\u201d approach \u2014 they may even enjoy it.Muddle ThroughA pandemic isn\u2019t forever. Probably. So if it\u2019s easier, leave historical practice aside, give guilt the vacation that you can\u2019t take and get through it. \u201cDon\u2019t think that there\u2019s something wrong with you or that you haven\u2019t been the perfect camp counselor and made it a fun and exciting and rewarding summer for everyone,\u201d Skenazy said. \u201cI mean, just give yourself a break.\u201dIf that break involves a lot of screens, remember that new entertainment forms and technologies \u2014 from the written word on \u2014 have always attracted suspicion that they will pulp or corrupt young minds. And most of us have turned out OK, no matter how many \u201cSmurfs\u201d episodes we may have once absorbed. Video games provide an opportunity to socialize, a streamed musical is still a musical, a virtual tour of a gallery or museum isn\u2019t the same as wandering the halls yourself, but take what you can get.In general, find out what your children like to do and encourage them to do it. Or go with the obverse: When you have time available, make them do stuff that you like. In my case, that means playing board games and watching toy theater videos on YouTube, plus the occasional Hayao Miyazaki movie. Or the more than occasional one.\u201cJust let them watch a lot of films,\u201d Hodgkinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s temporary, it\u2019s not forever. We really shouldn\u2019t be too hard on ourselves.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/arts/kids-summer-camps-virtual.html", "title": "Considering Camp?

But it can make my kid smile, and help soothe my uncertainty.", "authors": "By Kaitlyn Greenidge", "text": "ImageCredit...Adriana BelletI\u2019m taking a break this week, so I asked Kaitlyn Greenidge, an NYT Parenting contributor and the author of \u201cWe Love You, Charlie Freeman,\u201d to step in for me. Read her previous newsletter, about narrating the world for her daughter, here. \u2014 Jessica Grose, lead editor, NYT ParentingI bought the toddler-sized vacuum cleaner at 3 a.m. in early June. I felt slightly giddy when I pressed the button.I\u2019d just spent the past four hours scrolling Twitter, watching as police officers injured protesters, reading the vitriol trolls spew, stopping every so often for the more beautiful images \u2014 the black cowboys in Texas and the ballroom dancers doing death drops in the middle of a march and the Amish carrying Black Lives Matter signs.I\u2019d drunk in all the chaos, and I was jittery and sad and scared. My daughter was asleep beside me, and everyone in the house was asleep, too. I had no one to talk to about any of it at that moment. So I bought the toy vacuum cleaner for a little release.I knew I shouldn\u2019t do it. I knew consuming a child\u2019s hard-plastic toy that is probably going to end up at the bottom of the ocean in 15 years was a terrible response to all of those feelings. But it was an impulse that has been irresistible to me in these months of uncertainty.Since March, so many packages have come to the house in Massachusetts, where my daughter and I are quarantining with my sisters, nieces, brother-in-law and mother. My mom ordered something from Amazon nearly every day. My sister did, too. One of my nieces only emerged from her room for the mail check. She is just 11, but was engaged in a long-running, cat-and-mouse game with an off-brand earbud website. Every few days, the company sent her non-Apple earbuds that didn\u2019t work, and every few days she sent them back and requested a replacement. The company was not aware that they were playing this game with a sixth-grader who had infinite patience and still trusted that those in power would do the right thing.Purchasing nonessentials is always fraught for me. I grew up poor, when the miscalculation of overspending by $20 could mean the lights were out for a week or the car was repossessed.When you are poor, everyone has advice on what you can do to not be poor, but weirdly, none of it ever comes around to \u201cyour employer should pay you a living wage.\u201d Instead, there are many people who wish to tell you that if you just thought better about how to spend that $20, it wouldn\u2019t matter if you were chronically underpaid.So, as an adult, even small purchases can cause a panic attack. When my daughter was born, I was between regular paying gigs. I remember sobbing as I bought a smoothie at our local juice bar when my daughter was a few weeks old. I was one month away from a recurring paycheck with a comfortable amount of savings in the bank, but I was certain that that $6 would send my family into financial ruin.And for a smoothie! What a clich\u00e9 of a millennial parent I would be. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live the embarrassment down.I had hoped adulthood, relative financial stability and parenthood would cure me of this anxiety. I did not want to pass it on to my daughter or have her live in the tense atmosphere of it.But then quarantine and protests and all of a sudden it felt like my anxiety around purchases was justified. I have never bought more things on a whim than during this time: baby-sized tool kits, baby-sized musical instruments and so many novelty onesies.It\u2019s about control, of course. Life feels normal when I remind myself I can still buy things that will make my daughter laugh or things that will make her look cute. I can\u2019t say what our life will look like next year at this time, whether the record unemployment rates will come for our family. I can say that a toy truck will make her happy today.The craziest thing we\u2019ve bought during this spending frenzy is a pool. Not a big one. It is only 3 feet deep and 10 feet long. It happened because my sister and I were talking about what we would do with our kids during this Covid summer, when the Y was closed and we feared the beaches might be closed, too.In general, our quarantine house is a surprisingly harmonious set-up, but even our close family bonds would be stretched to the limit on the first hot, muggy day of summer. A pool, then, my sister suggested.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I said. \u201cThe property values. The housing insurance. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d my sister said. Then she and my mom bought the above-ground pool when I left the room to feed my daughter.\u201cIt was only $700,\u201d my sister said. \u201cIf the adults split the cost, it\u2019s not that much.\u201dI could feel the old wave of money anxiety coming, countered by this new wave of uncertainty for the future. I thought of the first hot day together. I imagined my daughter, who runs hot and always feels sweaty even on a 60-degree day, clinging to me, and the only relief being an electric fan.\u201cIt will be OK,\u201d my sister said.I spent the next night searching for pool floats. A sloth-shaped one will ship to me in two weeks, I am told.P.S. Click here to read all NYT Parenting coverage on coronavirus. Follow us on Instagram @NYTParenting. Join us on Facebook.

Then the coronavirus came and they had to act quickly.", "authors": "By Tammy La Gorce", "text": "The Zoom wedding of Victor Gabriel Santiago Hernandez and Dr. Erika Alejandro Crespo Mart\u00ednez, held on June 27 in their West Harlem studio apartment, was beamed to more than 75 households across Puerto Rico and planned in less than a month. It was the result of a question each had asked the other when New York City was in lockdown and chances of catching the coronavirus seemed higher than average: Why waste time?Their wedding was a surprising show of spontaneity from a couple whose relationship was built on patience and pacing.Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez, 28, and Mr. Santiago Hernandez, 27, met in San Juan in January 2016 when both were students at the University of Puerto Rico, from which they graduated. Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez was in her second year of dental school at the San Juan campus. Mr. Santiago Hernandez was studying graphic design at the Carolina campus. Mutual friends introduced them one January night at La Placita de Santurce, a marketplace and popular island hangout with restaurants and bars. Mr. Santiago Hernandez was distracted the rest of the night.\u201cYou know that feeling where you\u2019re with 20 people but you have your eye out for that one person, and when you can\u2019t see her you\u2019re looking around trying to find her?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it was with Erika. She brings this different sort of energy into a room.\u201dImageThe groom and bride prepare for their Spanish-only Zoom ceremony.Credit...Maridelis Morales Rosado for The New York TimesMr. Santiago Hernandez was too shy to get a sense of how intoxicating that energy might feel up close, so he added her on Facebook a few days later. She took the online bait with enthusiasm. \u201cI won\u2019t deny that I saw him first,\u201d she said. \u201cI liked that he wasn\u2019t trying to catch the attention of everybody in the room, that he was on the shy side.\u201dThe Facebook ping tallied their mutual connections at 20, reinforcing a sense that their meeting was inevitable. Still, two months of texting would go by before Mr. Santiago Hernandez gathered the courage to ask Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez for a date.When he finally did, a first glimpse of her at La Cubanita, a watering hole in Old San Juan, overwhelmed him with emotion. \u201cIt was something I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw her standing at the top of the steps wearing this blue dress, and time stopped for me. I took a picture of that moment in my mind that will always be with me. She looked like something out of a movie.\u201dTime flew that night for both. Within weeks Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez was forgoing weekends home with her family in Aguada, in the island\u2019s western coastal valley region, to spend time with Mr. Santiago Hernandez in San Juan. She didn\u2019t tell her parents why.ImageThey met in 2016 in San Juan when both were students at the University of Puerto Rico.\u00a0Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez was in dental school, while Mr. Santiago Hernandez was studying graphic design.Credit...Maridelis Morales Rosado for The New York Times\u201cVictor and I both have big families, and we\u2019re both really close with our families,\u201d Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez said.Her parents, Edwin Crespo and Denise Martinez, raised her and a younger brother, Francisco Crespo, alongside a batch of cousins and aunts and uncles in Aguada. Mr. Santiago Hernandez\u2019s family, in San Juan, includes his parents, Gabriel Santiago and Lydia Hernandez, his identical twin brother, Gabriel Antonio Santiago, and a younger brother, Antonio Santiago, plus a similarly long roll call of cousins and extended relatives.Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez\u2019s decision to keep the romance to herself was her way of protecting her family, and herself, from falling in love with Mr. Santiago Hernandez too quickly.She also knew the relationship was about to be tested. Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez had already planned a monthlong summer trip to Spain with dental school friends when she and Mr. Santiago Hernandez started seeing each other. \u201cI worried that he would get back to his regular routine and I would be left out,\u201d she said.Throughout the trip, though, they texted so much she rarely peeled her eyes from her phone. \u201cMy best friend kept saying, \u2018You are so in love with that guy,\u2019\u201d Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez said.By June 2018, when she graduated from dental school and Mr. Santiago Hernandez graduated college, they were embedded in each other\u2019s lives. Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez spent two weeks sheltering at Mr. Santiago Hernandez\u2019s parents\u2019 house during Hurricane Maria, and their parents started seeing each other socially. Happily ever after, though, was a ways off. Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez was leaving that month for a two-year residency at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, something she had set her sights on before she started dental school.ImageThe Brooklyn event planner Modern Rebel helped organize the wedding.

Still, his heart was sinking. \u201cIt started hitting me about a month before she was leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cI was counting the days. There was this place at La Placita we used to go to on Sunday nights where they had live music, and I kept thinking, maybe this is the last time we\u2019re going to be sitting here.\u201d His melancholy clung to him through his graduation, days after she left, but lifted temporarily when he opened a present from his parents. \u201cIt was a ticket to New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt meant so much, thinking I could hop on a plane and see her.\u201dDr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez settled into an apartment on the Upper West Side with Dr. Astrid Justiniano, a friend who was also a dental resident. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Mr. Santiago Hernandez. \u201cI would go to museums or dinners out, and I would always be thinking, I can\u2019t wait to show this to Victor,\u201d Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez said.[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]The wait was never long. After the trip his parents gave him, he lived his life in $300 increments. \u201cAs soon as I saved that much, I\u2019d start looking for cheap tickets to New York,\u201d Mr. Santiago Hernandez said. By 2019, they were seeing each other once a month in New York or Puerto Rico. To save money, he lived with his parents while working as a designer with DLC/Ogilvy, an advertising firm.Despite their efforts, the distance crept in. \u201cVictor was working so much that sometimes I would fall asleep before we had our nightly phone call,\u201d Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cWe were missing the small things, like having dinner together, going to sleep together,\u201d Mr. Santiago Hernandez said. Around December, he started plotting a permanent move to New York.ImageZoom guests toast the newlyweds.Credit...Maridelis Morales Rosado for The New York TimesIn February 2019, after kicking his money-saving habit into overdrive, he had scraped together $3,000. Enough, he hoped, to last him a few months while he looked for work in New York. \u201cI bought a one-way ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cI was extremely nervous.\u201dDr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez was feeling different emotions, including relief that he was coming and worry that she had pressured him into leaving his family and career. \u201cI was so happy, but it was stressful,\u201d she said. On Feb. 16, he moved into the apartment she shared with Ms. Justiniano.Dr. Justiniano, who now works as a dentist in Puerto Rico, had welcomed the extra roommate. \u201cIf you know Victor, you know how nice he is,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was always trying to be extra helpful and respectful. They were ashamed about him moving in, like it would be a problem for me. But it never bothered me, and they never got tired of each other, even in the tiny room they shared.\u201dMr. Santiago Hernandez\u2019s savings had dwindled to $106 by the time he got a job, in May 2019, as a digital designer with Intouch Solutions, a pharmaceutical marketing agency. \u201cI was close to making the decision, OK, no more advertising. I\u2019ll go to work at CVS or any store,\u201d he said. \u201cWe even had a conversation about me going back to Puerto Rico.\u201d Keeping his spirits afloat was Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez. She had grown up with a rule: On Fridays, the home kitchen is closed. She imported that rule to New York. \u201cEvery Friday, she would make sure she got me out of the apartment, that we went and got some nice food,\u201d Mr. Santiago Hernandez said. \u201cI was so proud of how she handled things.\u201dImage Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez wore a long white dress with spaghetti straps from ASOS, while Mr. Santiago Hernandez donned a Calvin Klein tuxedo.Credit...Maridelis Morales Rosado for The New York TimesThat summer, when Dr. Justiniano moved to Puerto Rico, they found a studio apartment in West Harlem. They had already started talking about marriage, but in March, as the coronavirus pushed into the city, Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez\u2019s work lent those talks new urgency. Several residents had been deployed to the hospital to help with the crisis. Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez, among them, was assigned a job screening patients in Montefiore Medical Center\u2019s emergency room.\u201cOur families were so worried, like what happens if one of us gets sick?,\u201d she said. Over a talk on the sofa in their studio in May, Mr. Santiago Hernandez and Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez decided to get married virtually. On Memorial Day, he asked her to step outside their apartment so he could call her parents and ask permission to marry her, in New York, without either family physically present. The blessings he hoped for were received, instantly.On June 27, with the help of Modern Rebel, a Brooklyn wedding planning company, Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez and Mr. Santiago Hernandez were married in a Spanish-only Zoom ceremony.

Mr. Santiago Hernandez wore a Calvin Klein tuxedo. They held hands while Ms. VillaRamos reminded them of the journey they had taken together. \u201cIt\u2019s been said that happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this moment is all about.\u201dAfter an exchange of vows and rings, during which Mr. Santiago Hernandez occasionally paused to brush tears from Dr. Crespo Mart\u00ednez\u2019s cheeks, Ms. VillaRamos pronounced them married. \u201cEven though the ground is shifting beneath us, you are in this together,\u201d she said.

He\u2019s curvaceous. I\u2019m just nervous.How did it come to this? The short answer: My stars were not aligned.The Long AnswerIn the West, the term \u201ckismet\u201d usually refers to a quirky serendipitous encounter, a blip in a universe powered by free will and randomness.But in India, the concept of kismet is an overpowering social force. Fate or destiny: It\u2019s not just inescapable, but a rational scapegoat for the bad times and a benevolent provider for the good times. It is almost an entity with its own will.It doesn\u2019t mean Indians who subscribe to this viewpoint don\u2019t work as hard or challenge themselves, like those who subscribe to a meritocratic universe. It just means they prepare spiritually for what lies ahead, akin to carrying an umbrella on a cloudy day. For many Indians, particularly certain Hindu castes, Vedic astrology is that umbrella.In every Indian city, fortune tellers set up shop between the chai stalls and sari stores. There are universities dedicated to astrological understanding, and TV shows of gurus fielding viewers\u2019 burning questions about the stars.As soon as someone is born, parents rush to their trusted astrologer to draw up a chart \u2014 a \u201cjanam kundli\u201d \u2014 that is said to map the exact position of the planets at the time of birth, down to the minute. This geometric constellation of diamonds and squares and triangles details everything from your constitution to what color you should wear for good luck to whatever that winking, smirking kismet has planned for you.As with Western astrology, the janam kundli map is split into \u201chouses\u201d: a house for profession, a house for wealth, a house for love and marriage, and even a house for illness. (While the zodiac signs of Western astrology are derived from the position of the sun, Vedic astrology considers the moon.) Each planet represents a force that is believed to have an impact the house in which it resides.According to the chart, Mars occupied my house for love and marriage. And that, in Vedic astrology, makes me \u201cmanglik,\u201d or Mars cursed.Plagued by a PlanetI and my oblivious, cursed self met my very human lover on Halloween in 2012.I was at a party when I saw him across the room, dressed as a mad scientist with naturally flowing salt-and-pepper hair. I was dressed as a sheriff, complete with a star badge. I was smitten in minutes. He didn\u2019t even ask for my number. It was only after some convincing on my end, via Facebook messenger, that he agreed to go on a date.But if I was comfortable going after Mr. Salt and Pepper, it took me three years to work up the courage to introduce him to my very traditional parents. My mother\u2019s first question: \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday and what time were you born?\u201dMangliks are urged to marry other mangliks, you see. Otherwise disaster ensues: arguments, incompatibility, even divorce or death.My mother took my boyfriend\u2019s birth date and time to several trusted astrologers and was told that, alas, my human lover and I would never work.\u201cHe\u2019ll leave her,\u201d one said.So she put her foot down, and refused to let me marry him.A rift was formed. My parents and I went months without talking to each other. I knew I wanted to marry Mr. Salt and Pepper. My stubbornness clashed with their stubborn views. That dry, red planet turned my home into a cold, dark shell.Life and Death With Mr. PotMy father scraped his way up from near nothing.He grew up in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, as the middle child in a family of six children, living a life of meager means.We are Sindhis, meaning our ancestors come from a province called Sindh that officially became Pakistani territory after the partition of India in 1947, which unleashed one of the largest and the most brutal refugee crises in history. Millions of Hindu Sindhis crossing over the new, freshly drawn border wound up in Jodhpur, like my father\u2019s grandmother.When my father turned 21, he sold cassettes and tapes. He worked for a recruitment agency in Mumbai. He tried his hand as a wedding videographer and photographer. One day, he chanced upon the opportunity to move to Hong Kong to trade leather goods and custom-made suits around Asia.That opportunity was the one that brought my family some financial security. My father worked himself to the bone in this new job, shuttling in and out of Hong Kong on red-eye flights and packing his days with back-to-back meetings. But, to this day, he credits kismet with much of his success. \u201cKismet gives you opportunities,\u201d he says.In Hong Kong, my father provided me with the luxury of a very international education, one that approached the world through a Western lens and defined kismet as a quirky serendipitous encounter, as mere coincidence. In other words, he afforded me the privilege to see life from a perspective different from his own.It was that privilege, in the end, that cleaved a generational, cultural and intellectual gap between us. When my parents told me that marrying my boyfriend would be disastrous, I fought back. \u201cBut I love him!\u201d I would say, angrily, because that was my strongest argument.At the time, my boyfriend had moved to New York for work while I stayed in Hong Kong, and we remained in a committed, long-distance relationship.\u201cLove isn\u2019t enough,\u201d they would say back. In their eyes, Mr. Salt and Pepper was poised to destroy my life, and my mother would continue to say, look, he\u2019s settled in New York now, he won\u2019t come back for you, it\u2019s time to move on, \u201cit is kismet.\u201dI refused to listen. I would text my boyfriend every morning and every evening to keep our relationship alive across time zones and despite my family\u2019s pressure. I simply would not indulge their narrow-mindedness. I would say, I am not that way. I am smarter, I am more modern and therefore I am right, I thought, failing to understand then that I was only any of those things because of them.Faced with my stubborn will, my parents turned back to their astrologers. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d they asked.As it turns out, there was one imperfect solution: a \u201ckumbh vivah.\u201dYou guessed it. It\u2019s the pot marriage.Kumbh vivahs are still quite common among Hindus in India. Even the former Miss World and Bollywood megastar, Aishwarya Rai Bachan, is rumored to have gone through the ritual. (She, apparently, married a tree.) In Amazon\u2019s 2019 Indian series \u201cMade In Heaven,\u201d there is an entire episode dedicated to this phenomenon. The couple in that episode, like me and Mr. Salt and Pepper, are also modern and Western-educated, struggling to align their views with the more archaic views of their families.That it is mostly manglik girls that are expected to participate in this ceremony, which many have argued places the burden on women to fix astrological defects \u2014 no matter your views, that\u2019s a herculean task, to say the least \u2014 was part of my resistance to it.But at the end of the day, I wanted my parents to be happy for me and I wanted our relationship to heal. They wanted me to be safe from heartbreak.So, on the established date, I sat in a temple in Hong Kong. There was a pundit reciting mantras, and while my parents sat cross-legged near me, I held Mr. Pot in my hands.When the prayers ended, we stood up together, and walked outside the temple to a quiet, deserted space.And then I smashed my new husband into the ground, shattering him into tiny pieces. The thinking is that the pot stands in for my husband, the one with which things are destined to go awry, and breaking it symbolizes the end of that ill-fated relationship. Ostensibly, the curse was lifted.Eight months later, I married Mr. Salt and Pepper under the blue skies of Bali, surrounded by gleaming family and friends. We walked around a fire, we exchanged vows and danced all night. Most important, my parents delightfully embraced my husband. They were all in.This union, it turns out, was not the break from tradition we all anticipated; this is not a tale of patronizing Orientalism, overcome. The last thing I want is to reinforce any stereotypical imaginings of India as a land of elephants and snake charmers and women who marry trees.No, the story of my pot and me is one of respect. For myth, for belief, for culture and ritual and history, those ineffable things that swirl through generations, tying us to who we are as individuals. It\u2019s a story of what unites us: hopes, fears, passions and the past, all pushing us to find our safety nets.Will I expect my future children to marry a pot? No. But in my doing so, did my parents rest better knowing that they fulfilled that universal urge of fiercely protecting their offspring in the best way they know? Yes.And I\u2019ve been happily married for four years. Make of that what you wish."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/fashion/weddings/reflections-of-a-wedding-singer.html", "title": "Reflections of a Wedding Singer", "summary": "She looked everywhere for proof of the magic of love and has managed to center her work life on finding it.", "authors": "By Rachel Anne Warren", "text": "By Rachel Anne WarrenThe fourth wall is strong enough to keep a huge guy from acknowledging when he crashes into the bandstand, spilling his drink equally on me and into the monitor, the thud of a heavy metal microphone hitting the floor.

We want you to remember the joy of fashion and learn (or remember) how to make things at home. Some of fashion\u2019s best-known creative talents will be on hand to guide you through the process.\u201cDuring my mom\u2019s Mexican youth, girls used to embroider their boyfriend\u2019s initials on a handkerchief with their own hair,\u201d Rick Owens wrote in an email from Paris, where he and his wife, Michele Lamy, live. Though hair can be a disconcerting substance when not attached to one\u2019s own head, it has a rich history of use as a memento mori, used through the ages by artists, hobbyists, fetishists and smitten teens.\u201cI loved that story,\u201d Mr. Owens said. \u201cSo I asked my mom to embroider a handkerchief with her hair for me.\u201dYears later, when the designer\u2019s friends started having children, he plucked strands of his signature raven locks and embroidered the newborns\u2019 initials on baby blankets that he gave to the new parents as gifts.Though the baroque atmospherics of the instructions below are not required (Mr. Owens may have been, as he wrote, on magic mushrooms when he composed them), it probably helps to be in some kind of swoon while you sew.ImageYour tool kitThree long strands of your own hairOne 35-by-35-inch silk handkerchiefOne Clover No. 3-9 gold-eye embroidery needleAn embroidery hoopImageSTEP 1\u201cFirst, wash your silky hair in the milk of an ass, just as Claudette Colbert did while playing Empress Poppea,\u201d Mr. Owens wrote, referring to the actress\u2019s racy turn in \u201cThe Sign of the Cross,\u201d Cecil B.

But they are even more multipurpose than you might expect, or so say Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte. The sisters are known for their imagination and ability to find beauty in unexpected places.\u201cWe are all stuck at home, but even if you are just hauling laundry from one room to another, it makes you feel better to be able to put stuff away in something that cheers you up,\u201d Laura Mulleavy said. \u201cWe have so many dish towels around and are always in need of reusable totes that we can also use as storage.\u201dSo they decided to make one out of a dish towel and some costume jewelry. Here\u2019s how you can, too.ImageYour tool kit:One cotton or linen dish towel, approximately 20 by 27 inches. Ideally striped (it will make the project easier), but any pattern will do.Two costume jewelry necklaces, like the plastic beaded kind that are handed out at Mardi Gras, or one chain-link plastic necklace.One thick ribbonSewing machine with cotton-poly thread or, if you are sewing by hand, a tapestry needle and embroidery thread.Straightedge rulerScissorsImageSTEP 1Fold your chosen dish towel in half so that the inside is on the outside.ImageSTEP 2Create a bottom. At the fold, measure two inches on each side, vertically. Mark and draw a line from one dot to the other. Then flatten the lower part of the folded towel so that it makes a T-shape perpendicular to the body, four inches across. This will become the \u201cbottom\u201d of the tote.ImageSTEP 3Sew each side of the flattened part together with a straight stitch half an inch from each edge so that the sides of the T are closed. This will form a V-shaped notch at the bottom of the towel. If looked at from the side, it will resemble a Y.ImageSTEP 4Sew each side together with a straight stitch, vertically from the bottom of the V to the upper end of the folded towel. Invert the bag and press the bottom open to make a floor.ImageSTEP 5Make the sides. Measure a quarter of an inch from each side seam and straight stitch vertically from the top around the bottom and up the other side to create a soft rectangular side that will turn the sac into a box shape.ImageSTEP 6Fold each necklace in half.ImageSTEP 7Cut a ribbon in four pieces, each piece four inches long. Loop each ribbon through each of the four ends in the two lengths of necklace, bringing the ends of the ribbon together.ImageSTEP 8Measure to the center of the upper, open rim of the bag. Then measure three and a half inches from there in either direction and mark those spots. That is where the loops, or the two ends of the handles, will go.ImageSTEP 9Secure the loops to the bag at two stitch points, the upper one one-eighth of an inch from the top edge of the bag, the lower one one-eighth of an inch from the bottom of the loop ribbon.ImageSTEP 10Put bag over your arm and go!Photograph via Rodarte"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/style/tie-dye-plaid-with-collina-strada.html", "title": "How to Turn Vegetables Into a Tie-Dye Pattern", "summary": "", "authors": "By Jessica Testa", "text": "DESIGNER D.I.Y.

Like by dyeing a white T-shirt using beets and turmeric.\u201cI look at tie-dye as a form of hand-painting on clothes,\u201d Ms. Taymour said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to make exact replica tie-dyes.\u201dShe has been using tie-dye in her collections since 2018, sometimes with three to six different techniques in one garment, elevating the summer camp pastime into an artisanal practice. Here, she demonstrates one technique: the subtle plaid tie-dye.Your tool kitWhite T-shirt3 beets1/3 cup turmericSplash of white vinegar. (Apple cider vinegar will do in a pinch.)2 pots and 2 large mixing bowls2 rubber bandsA spoonImageCredit...Charlie EngmanSTEP 1Make the dye.Prepare two pots of boiling water. Cut up the beets and place in one pot, allowing them to boil for one hour. Add a splash of the vinegar. This will help your dye hold pigment.Pour the turmeric into the second pot and boil for eight minutes.When both dyes are done, pour them into two bowls (or similar large containers).STEP 2Fold your shirt.Lay the shirt on a flat surface.Pinch the fabric between the neck and shoulder seam of the T-shirt. Carefully drag it toward the middle of the shirt, creating a vertical fold down the centerline of the shirt. Fold the sleeve inward, too, aligning its edge with the far end of the fold that you just made.Repeat on the other side of the shirt. You should have one long column.ImageCredit...Charlie EngmanSTEP 3Fold your shirt \u2026 again.Pick up the shirt and carefully fold it vertically down the centerline, outward or away from you. (You\u2019re folding one of the long halves behind the other, making your column thinner by half.)Lay the column flat, and imagine it was horizontally broken up into four pieces.You\u2019ll be piling the four quarters on top of one another, but alternating the direction of the folds. You can start by folding the bottom quarter upward. Then take that two-layer stack and fold it underneath the next quarter of the shirt. Continue alternating folds until the shirt looks like a thick rectangle.ImageCredit...Charlie EngmanSTEP 4Grab your two rubber bands.With the rectangle vertical, wrap two rubber bands around the shirt horizontally so that the shirt is split into three segments.STEP 5Time to dye!Using a spoon, start dropping turmeric dye into the center of the shirt. Leave the edges white. Make sure the dye saturates through all of the layers, spooning the turmeric in between each fold.Now pick up the bundle and dip the white edges into the beet dye, counting to 15 seconds, and repeating on all four sides. Essentially your rectangle should have a yellow center with a pink frame.ImageCredit...Charlie EngmanImageCredit...Charlie EngmanImageCredit...Charlie EngmanSTEP 6Set the bundle aside for 10 minutes.Open it up and lay it flat to dry overnight.

Months ago, in the early stages of the pandemic, he saw very little makeup when he ran out on the occasional errand. Lately, though, he has noticed that the faces are changing, slowly. Masks are plentiful, as are filled-in brows and lashes coated in mascara.\u201cSo many people are doing this,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to get dressed and get cute, even if it\u2019s just to get groceries.\u201dDismissing makeup as frivolity would be easier than ever now. Our professional and social lives are scaled down, and we\u2019ve withdrawn inside. Collectively we\u2019ve gone back to basics, and makeup is plainly nonessential. But it is also a cultural artifact, reflecting the aesthetics and ethos of the era. What will our faces show as we live through months or years of the pandemic?Nick Barose, a makeup artist, looked back and found makeup\u2019s future. At the beginning of his lockdown in March, he organized his Brooklyn apartment \u201cto make it more homey, since I\u2019d actually be home,\u201d he said.That\u2019s when he discovered reference materials \u2014 books, images, magazine tear sheets \u2014 he had used as he learned to do makeup. He was drawn to avant-garde beauty editorials of the 1980s, with images of Old Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe. The nostalgia boosted his mood.\u201cYou can listen to \u201980s music, put on \u201980s makeup and fantasize about a life that\u2019s not yours,\u201d Mr. Barose said.Makeup, he predicts, will take two distinct courses as the pandemic plays out. The first will be practical and edited, emphasizing long-wear products and natural brows and lashes. But for some, makeup will be an escape.\u201cOur reality is so uncertain that I can see people getting experimental,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary time, so it\u2019s a time when you want to dream more, too.\u201dImageBasics of the new face by the makeup artist Keita Moore.Credit...via Keita MooreImageCredit...via Keita MooreMake Foundation Transfer-ProofBecause much of the face is covered, foundation should be used sparingly, if at all.

If you use foundation, a light application on the exposed areas is all you need.\u201cMost women choose foundation for the look,\u201d said Keanda Snagg, a makeup artist, meaning that they\u2019re going for color match and finish and are usually not as concerned about performance. Now is the time to consider a formula\u2019s staying power, too. Ms. Snagg suggests Fenty Pro Filt\u2019r Hydrating Longwear Foundation, $35.Mr. Moore swears by Premiere Products Blue Marble Selr Spray, $14, a cult favorite setting spray, to keep makeup in place. \u201cA lot of drag queens use it when they perform onstage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes your makeup absolutely transfer-proof. You could lie down on a pillow and there\u2019d be no foundation on it after you got up.\u201dErin Parsons, another makeup artist, predicts that foundation formulas will evolve to focus on skin care. \u201cMasks will shift how we think about foundation,\u201d Ms. Parsons said. \u201cWhen you take them off, your skin is irritated and red. I keep thinking the next generation of foundation will be soothing and protecting.\u201dEmphasize Brows and LashesThe new basic face is filled-in brows and amplified lashes. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we should learn now, it\u2019s how to properly fill in your brows,\u201d Mr. Moore said. Eyebrow pencils give users more control of color density (and most people go too dark on brows), so he prefers them to powders, which can be blotchy.\u201cPeople tend to fill in too much at the inner part of the brows,\u201d he said. \u201cFocus on the tail because that\u2019s where most brows are sparse. Brush your brows up and outward and fill in only where you need more hair.\u201dPick a pencil with an angled flat tip, like the Lip Bar Hi-Brow Gel + Pencil, $14. This shape helps you mimic the look and direction of hair growth.The Lashify at-home lash extension kit, $145, creates a lash look that\u2019s a step up from a coat of mascara. The system contains individual lashes, so your result is customizable. \u201cYou can just add a couple lashes to the outer end of your lashes for more drama,\u201d Mr. Moore said.ImageMore mask makeup looks by Mr. Barose.Credit...via Nick BaroseImageCredit...via Nick BaroseIntroduce Color With EyelinerAs our time in masks wears on, makeup artists expect we\u2019ll transition to eye makeup that\u2019s simple yet expressive. Eyeliner is the best tool for these times because it\u2019s uncomplicated. A bright color is interesting and fun without requiring the layering and dimension of eye shadow.\u201cMy favorite is winged eyeliner in any bright color \u2014 pink, blue, burgundy \u2014 anything that\u2019s not black,\u201d Ms. Snagg said. She likes NYX Epic Wear Liquid Liner, $10, a waterproof formula. (\u201cYou could jump in a pool and it wouldn\u2019t budge,\u201d she said.)An eyeliner newbie can start with a simple line along the lashes and, with practice, work up to a wing. Ms. Snagg\u2019s winged liner technique: Draw a triangle at the outer corner of the eye. Then, using gentle strokes, create a line that connects that triangle to the inner corner of your eye.Embrace the Freedom of MasksDuring his lockdown, Mr. Barose made himself up in the style of celebrities representing different eras, like Grace Jones, Donyale Luna and Elizabeth Taylor. \u201cBecause I\u2019m being someone else, I feel more free to do things I\u2019ve never done,\u201d he said. \u201cA mask covering your face is similar. It\u2019s a superhero effect because you\u2019re incognito.\u201dIf you favor subdued or minimal makeup, this can be a time to explore, to try new textures and materials. \u201cAfter a period of minimal makeup, I could see a resurgence of the \u2018Euphoria\u2019 makeup \u2014 people trying things that are a little weird because they\u2019re not as exposed,\u201d Ms. Parsons said.For example, earlier this year, she used a prosthetic adhesive to affix tiny dried flowers she found on Amazon to the ends of lashes. \u201cPeople have been asking me about it all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to do. It\u2019s cute, and it makes you happy.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/style/skin-damage-blue-light-what-is-all-of-that-screen-time-doing-to-your-skin.html", "title": "What Is All of That Screen Time Doing to Your Skin?", "summary": "We checked in with experts to learn about the risks of indoor light and how we can protect ourselves.", "authors": "By Crystal Martin", "text": "You\u2019ve probably heard more about the perils of blue light lately because our lives are more likely to be lived indoors and online. Our laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and even LED light bulbs are all sources of blue light. And now that we\u2019re tethered to those devices, are we getting drenched? Should we be more worried about damage to our skin?Here\u2019s what we know: Compared with the well-understood dangers of ultraviolet light (skin aging and cancer), science isn\u2019t settled on the effects of indoor sources of blue light on skin. It can cause hyperpigmentation and premature aging, but the rest \u2014 what dose of it causes trouble, for instance \u2014 was debated well before we were confined to our homes.Here, we\u2019ve checked in with some blue light and skin experts to help us understand the real risks.What is blue light?When we think about the harmful effects of light, we\u2019re usually thinking ultraviolet light (UV), which is invisible. But we can see blue light. You may perceive it as a cool-toned white light (as with an LED light bulb), or you may not be aware of much blue at all. That\u2019s because your indoor light sources are emitting varying wavelengths that combine to create the colors you perceive.Though the effects of blue light on the skin are yet to be fully understood, the light is an important health concern because of other risks. \u201cBlue light damages the retina and reduces your excretion of melatonin, so it interrupts your sleep cycle,\u201d said Michelle Henry, a dermatologist in New York.Proximity is, of course, a factor when thinking about the danger. \u201cYou\u2019ll get less blue light from your TV than from your computer because it\u2019s farther away,\u201d Dr. Henry said. \u201cAnd more light from your phone than your computer because your phone is so close to your face.\u201dHow does blue light damage my skin?While ultraviolet light damages cells\u2019 DNA directly, blue light destroys collagen through oxidative stress. A chemical in skin called flavin absorbs blue light. The reaction that takes place during that absorption produces unstable oxygen molecules (free radicals) that damage the skin.\u201cThey go in and basically poke holes in your collagen,\u201d Dr. Henry said.Exposure to blue light is more problematic for skin of color. In a 2010 study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, it was shown to cause hyperpigmentation in medium to dark skin, while leaving lighter skin relatively unaffected.The medical community categorizes skin color based on how it reacts to UV light. Type 1 is the lightest color with the most UV sensitivity. \u201cThis would be Nicole Kidman and Conan O\u2019Brien,\u201d said Mathew M. Avram, the director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Dermatology Laser and Cosmetic Center in Boston. The scale goes up to Type 6, which is the darkest and least likely to burn.In the 2010 study, Type 2 skin was exposed to blue light but didn\u2019t develop pigmentation. Skin of color darkened, and that darkness persisted for a couple of weeks.\u201cThere is something about the pigmentation in Types 4, 5 and 6 that reacts differently than in patients with fair skin,\u201d Dr. Avram said. \u201cThere should be more large-scale studies looking at this because pigmentation is one of the biggest patient concerns and the one where treatment creates less patient satisfaction.\u201dBut isn\u2019t blue light used to treat acne?Yes, blue light lamps treat acne and precancerous lesions. \u201cIt damages the skin, but on the other hand it can treat acne,\u201d Dr. Avram said. \u201cIt can help your mood and memory as well. So it\u2019s more complicated than just saying \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad.\u2019\u201dHow can I prevent skin damage?The simplest intervention is to limit the amount of blue light emitted from your devices. Apple products have \u201cnight shift\u201d that creates a warmer screen tone. Swap out your standard LED bulbs for versions that emit less blue light.Mineral sunscreens with iron oxides are the gold standard in blue light protection. Iron oxides have been shown to be more protective against visible light than zinc oxide and titanium dioxide alone.\u201cA good cheat for this is any tinted sunscreen, which usually has iron oxide,\u201d Dr. Henry said. Skinbetter Science Sunbetter Tone Smart SPF 68 Sunscreen Compact, $55, is one such mineral sunblock. The formula combines zinc oxide, titanium dioxide and iron oxide, and it blends smoothly, even on brown skin.Topical antioxidants should help tame the free radicals blue light creates, but again, the science isn\u2019t fully formed.\u201cI cannot recommend antioxidants from a purely scientific perspective,\u201d said Alexander Wolf, a senior assistant professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo and an expert in how light and oxidative stress cause premature aging. \u201cBut there are certainly a lot of experiments that show antioxidants work well in cultured cells. Vitamin C enters the cells directly, and if you do some oxidative damage to the cells, the vitamin C or some antioxidant definitely helps.\u201d\u201cBut a dish with some cells is not skin,\u201d Dr. Wolf added.As long as you\u2019re clear that antioxidants haven\u2019t been proven to work on blue light, but would likely work, they are a good substitute for sunscreen if you feel weird about sitting at home with a face full of minerals. It\u2019s likely that antioxidants will also minimize the damage of a blue LED light device used at home to treat acne. (A mineral sunscreen would block the blue light and stop its bacteria-killing action.)As far as antioxidants go, vitamin C is a good choice because the molecule is actually small enough to penetrate the skin. Hyper Skin Hyper Clear Brightening Clearing Vitamin C Serum, $36, contains 15 percent vitamin C paired with vitamin E, and the two ingredients boost each other\u2019s potential to fight free radicals.The buzz around blue light has led to new lines like Goodhabit. Its Rescue Me Glow Potion Oil Serum, $80, combines marine-sourced proteins with exopolysaccharides \u2014 that is, polymers secreted by microorganisms that create a protective barrier over the skin. The polymers act like a sunscreen that blocks blue light (rather than neutralizing free radicals like an antioxidant).Though alpha-lipoic acid is not touted for its blue light protective qualities, Dr. Wolf has studied its effect on oxidative stress (in mouse skin) and thinks it is promising for human skin.\u201cIt works differently than an antioxidant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt activates the natural defenses of the skin cell by tricking the skin cell to think, \u2018Oh, there is oxidative stress.\u2019 The cell turns up its own defense mechanisms. I think that\u2019s a much more elegant way to defend yourself.\u201dPerricone MD High Potency Classics: Face Finishing & Firming Moisturizer, $69, contains both vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid.One important fact is often left out of the blue light conversation: The sun is by far our most abundant source of blue light.\u201cBrightness is not something the human eye is good at gauging because the pupil adjusts,\u201d Dr. Wolf said. \u201cYou may think your tablet or smartphone is bright, but as far as the amount of light reaching your skin, it is very weak, especially compared to the sun.\u201dAll things considered, then, your blue light exposure may well be down when compared to your pre-pandemic life for the simple reason that you\u2019re spending more time indoors."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/style/coronavirus-haircuts-barbers.html", "title": "Need a Haircut?", "summary": "A longing for professional grooming is leading some unshorn citizenry to seek out barbering on the sly.", "authors": "By Rachel Felder", "text": "A few weeks ago, Samuel Logan, a fashion executive, put on a protective mask and took a short subway ride to Greenwich Village for a highly anticipated, clandestine tryst. In the middle of a sunny afternoon, he covertly met his barber on a deserted street to get a haircut and beard trim.The appointment had little in common with a typical trim. They walked silently up an empty flight of stairs, through a darkened hallway and into the vacant barbershop, its window shades drawn to conceal the activity inside. Mr. Logan brought along two items that seemed essential: disinfectant spray, in case the barber\u2019s chair needed a germ-busting spritz, and a baseball cap to hide the evidence of newly shorn locks when he left.\u201cIt felt like I had just made a deal to buy a case of bathtub gin,\u201d Mr. Logan said.He was understandably furtive. Salons in New York have been closed by government order since late March, as they have across much of the country. (In a few states, including Georgia, they\u2019ve recently been allowed to reopen.) Since then, a longing for professional grooming has become a leitmotif on social media, with a deluge of images of scraggly, overgrown hair and sad attempts at self-administered haircuts, along with instructional videos on how to do a trim at home.Inevitably, some hairstylists and their regular clients have, like Mr. Logan, been skirting governmental restrictions.\u201cIn terms of barbers getting out there to cut hair, they\u2019re going to do that,\u201d said Damon Dorsey, president of the American Barber Association, a nonprofit organization with several thousand members across the country. \u201cThere are going to be some people who are just going to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take my chances\u2019 and some barbers that are saying that, too.\u201dGetting a haircut at the moment tends to be focused more on efficiency than on pleasure. Recently a loyal client of a salon in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles \u2014 let\u2019s call her Michelle since she asked for anonymity because she was dodging government regulations \u2014 met her stylist for an overdue trim in his shuttered space.Michelle had washed her hair at home to speed up the process; their usual relaxed banter was curtailed, in no small part because their faces were covered by masks.\u201cI was anxious to get it done,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lean into that moment. I wanted to be in and out.\u201d She left the same way she arrived: sneaking through an alleyway to her discreetly parked car for a drive down a traffic-free highway.Some hairstylists are seeing regular clients on house calls, often in a client\u2019s yard or garden. Joey Silvestera, the owner of the Blackstones salons in downtown Manhattan, did his first such appointment a few days ago. His barbershop was the backyard of a client\u2019s home, a 15-minute drive from East Hampton, where Mr. Silvestera has been staying with his family since both Blackstones locations closed in mid-March.Instead of his usual work wear of a black T-shirt and leather jacket, he dressed in a de facto hazmat suit: a Dickies cotton jumpsuit he described in a phone interview as \u201ca onesie.\u201d The appointment was a test run for a weekly cut he plans to schedule with a faithful client, vetted through a list of health-related questions that, in calmer times, would be reserved for a doctor\u2019s office.\u201cI\u2019m not playing around,\u201d Mr. Silvestera said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re on the same page, I\u2019m not going.\u201dJulien Howard, a barber who lives in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, is planning to cut hair quietly on the roof of his apartment building, or on clients\u2019 terraces. He has done one such haircut already, upstairs from his top-floor apartment, wearing a makeshift version of personal protective equipment that included black nitrile gloves and a pair of round Saint Laurent sunglasses.\u201cI feel like in the open air there\u2019s less chance of getting a germ than if I\u2019m in a closed environment like someone\u2019s bathroom,\u201d Mr. Howard said.For the rooftop service, he brought an array of equipment, including a hot towel machine and a glass bottle of disinfecting Barbicide. \u201cI had the whole experience of the barbershop but outdoors, in the open air,\u201d he said.In lieu of cash or a Venmo transaction, he was paid with a handful of N-95 masks, along with a protective contraption that a graffiti artist might wear to keep spray-paint fumes at bay.Mr. Howard is accustomed to cutting hair outside of a salon. Before the lockdown, he was making house calls through the V\u00e9lo Barber, a business he founded. Those appointments have been suspended since salons, including Blind Barber in the East Village where he also worked a few days a week, closed.Other businesses that usually facilitate at-home haircuts \u2014 like the on-demand app and website Glamsquad and Paul Mol\u00e9, the venerable barbershop on the Upper East Side, which normally send stylists to people\u2019s homes \u2014 have similarly halted house calls for the time being.While most salons are following government orders strictly, the temptation for both stylists and their customers remains.\u201cUntil there is enough testing, we can\u2019t in good conscience break with the social distancing protocols,\u201d said Steve Marks, the owner of Persons of Interest, a chain of three barbershops in Brooklyn. \u201cThat said, people can\u2019t wait till July to get a haircut, so they\u2019ll find a way.\u201dHe has heard, he said, that one of the barbers from his Williamsburg salon is planning to see clients in his backyard nearby. He\u2019s not standing in his way."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/style/how-to-touch-up-your-roots-at-home.html", "title": "How to Touch Up Your Roots at Home", "summary": "", "authors": "By Crystal Martin", "text": "March 31, 2020ImageHow to Touch Up Your Roots at HomeHere\u2019s what you should and shouldn\u2019t do.By Crystal MartinRachel Bodt has been mulling over the relevance of hair color in our new lives.\u201cI think it comes down to doing whatever we can to make ourselves feel good,\u201d said Ms. Bodt, a colorist. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at your roots and feel like you just have to fix them, just do it.\u201dBut where to start? Experts say deciding how to maintain your color at home isn\u2019t just about the shade \u2014 what red, brown or blond do I use? It\u2019s also about how different your faux color is from your natural shade. That assessment determines what tools you\u2019ll need, Ms. Bodt said.If You\u2019re Showing Only Subtle RootsImageCredit...Illustration by Ema GasparYour hair has grown out, but the roots are pretty subtle. Your dye job is a gentle change from your natural hair color. You\u2019re coloring a little gray, or you\u2019ve gone from brunette to a different shade of brown. If this sounds like you, root cover-up sprays and powders will help.For little patches of gray peeking through at the hairline, use a powder like Color Wow Root Cover Up, $34.50. A powder is easier to control in small areas than a spray. For a larger area, use a spray like Rita Hazan Root Concealer Touch-Up Spray, $25.Pick the shade that best matches your hair and apply it conservatively. It\u2019s better to layer on a little more if you need it. \u201cAnd do it in your bathroom so you\u2019re not getting spray on anything you can\u2019t wipe down,\u201d Ms. Bodt said. If You Have a Conspicuous Line of DemarcationImageCredit...Illustration by Ema GasparSay you\u2019re covering a lot of gray or going from light to dark or brown to red. Root touch-up sprays won\u2019t cut it for you. Try an at-home permanent dye.\u201cThe No. 1 rule when touching up your own color is put color only where it\u2019s needed \u2014 on the roots,\u201d said Jaxcee, a colorist and a founder of the Coily Collective at the Riccardo Maggiore Salon on Fifth Avenue. People mistakenly think they have to pull the dye through the entire length of hair so it will blend well.\u201cIf you keep putting dye where there\u2019s already color, your hair will look opaque and less natural,\u201d Jaxcee said. \u201cImagine the guys who use spray-on color in a can.\u201d She suggests using a thick conditioner or coconut oil on the parts of your hair that you aren\u2019t coloring to prevent dye from penetrating.Personalized colors from online companies like Color & Co and Madison Reed are the best choice and are delivered to your home.\u201cMy clients have had success with those brands,\u201d Ms. Bodt said. \u201cThe shades are realistic and beautiful and don\u2019t damage the hair. And when clients come to their next appointments, I\u2019ve been able to color their hair nicely, which isn\u2019t always the case with drugstore dye.\u201dThe biggest challenge is selecting the right shade. Color & Co and Madison Reed have questionnaires that generate shade options.\u201cGo with the color that is closest to your current color,\u201d Jaxcee said. But the most important feature of at-home color is its tone, she said. Is your current color neutral, warm or cool?And think about your past experiences with hair dye. Does your hair tend to pick up color easily? If so, and you\u2019re picking between shades, choose a lighter color.\u201cAs a rule, at-home color is more concentrated,\u201d Jaxcee said. \u201cThe dye load is heavy because companies want to make users feel like their result is luscious and rich.\u201dIf you\u2019re still having trouble deciding, reach out to your stylist for some guidance. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping my clients take the online questionnaires and have even walked them through dyeing over FaceTime,\u201d Ms. Bodt said.If you do get that level of help, offering your stylist, who is likely out of work, some cash is a nice gesture.Here are a few additional tips from the experts:Test it out. If you\u2019re a first-timer or otherwise still nervous, work through the whole process on a hidden piece of hair at the back of your head.Wear a button-down shirt while applying. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have to remove a shirt over year head when it\u2019s time to rinse,\u201d Ms. Bodt said.Prime your hairline. Apply Vaseline or ChapStick to prevent staining.Deep condition to maintain. Nonprofessional color can be drying to your hair. Use a moisturizing treatment at least once a week. Jaxcee also recommends a strengthening treatment, Olaplex No. 5, $28, that repairs bonds in the hair that are broken during the dyeing process.If You Have HighlightsImageCredit...Illustration by Ema Gaspar\u201c\u2018Lived-in\u2019 has been the look in highlights for a while,\u201d Ms. Bodt said. \u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing a little root with highlights. People should leave them alone.\u201dBleaching, the chemical process that lightens your hair, is difficult to do well, even by professionals. And it\u2019s damaging. If you D.I.Y. it, you\u2019ll probably end up breaking off your hair.Highlighting is always a two-step process. First, bleach lightens the hair (melanin is removed from the shaft). Then, the newly lightened hair is toned, a color-depositing process that gives highlights an exact shade \u2014 say, a cool ash blond or a warm bronze-y brown. Instead of trying to bleach your roots, you should mimic only the second part of the process: toning.\u201cWhen we perceive our highlights as looking bad, it\u2019s usually not about the roots as much as the color and texture,\u201d Ms Bodt said. \u201cThe hair looks brassy, dull or frizzy.\u201dBlond highlights almost universally get brassy (orange) over time. Ms. Bodt suggests a purple conditioner, K\u00e9rastase Blond Absolu Masque Ultra-Violet Purple Hair Mask, $62. \u201cIt corrects both the tone and deeply moisturizes the hair so it\u2019s shinier and de-frizzed,\u201d she said.For brunette and red highlights, she suggests Evo Fabuloso Colour Boosting Treatment, $35, which comes in eight shades. For example, there\u2019s a copper (warm red) and a purple red (cool).\u201cAgain, if you\u2019re having trouble figuring out which treatment color is right for your hair, reach out to your stylist for advice,\u201d Ms. Bodt said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/style/deva-curl-hair-loss.html", "title": "Did a Cult Hair-Care Line Cause Thousands of Women to Lose Their Hair?", "summary": "DevaCurl, which for many women represented a hard-won acceptance of their curls, is a target of class-action lawsuits.", "authors": "By Courtney Rubin", "text": "Ayesha Malik\u2019s long dark hair once fell in such unbelievably perfect Botticelli curls that in 2017 she felt compelled to take to YouTube to prove to online naysayers that she didn\u2019t use a curling iron or wear a wig.Her hair-care routine included DevaCurl products, which she promoted first as a fan and then, inevitably, as an influencer, flown by the company to New York and Miami from her home in Anchorage to meet fans and post about the brand. But on Jan. 31 of this year, after many months of bad hair days, itching and hair loss she could no longer hide, Ms. Malik posted a 16-minute talk, titled \u201cWhy I Stopped Using DevaCurl,\u201d in which the natural state of her curls appears to be frizzy, as if she\u2019d vigorously brushed them out.\u201cIf you\u2019ve bought DevaCurl products because of me, I am sorry,\u201d she says in the video, which has been viewed more than 2.3 million times on YouTube. \u201cAnd if you are currently using these products, stop immediately.\u201dMs. Malik, 29, is among the most well known of the thousands of women (and a few men) blaming DevaCurl for problems ranging from misshapen and deflated curls to inflamed scalps to hair loss. Stephanie Mero, a hairstylist in Orlando, Fla., who formerly sold (and used) DevaCurl, started a Facebook group called Hair Damage & Hair Loss from DevaCurl \u2014 You\u2019re not CRAZY or ALONE. It has nearly 60,000 members, a lot of pictures of thinning hair and bald spots, and a thread for those considering chopping off all their hair. (Ms. Mero has.)There are also at least 10 class-action lawsuits pending, including four in New York, in which customers say DevaCurl damaged their scalps and made their hair fall out in clumps. (Neither Ms. Malik or Ms. Mero have joined the suits, they said in interviews. Ms. Mero, 29, is mulling her options; Ms. Malik has retained a lawyer and is considering her legal options \u201cbecause no one\u2019s ever going to get hair advice from me ever again.\u201d)For a generation of women who grew up straightening their hair, DevaCurl represented a hard-won path to curl acceptance, and customers talked about the brand with religious fervor.\u201cDevaCurl is the first brand I used that worked well with my hair and sold me on our lord and savior, the CGM,\u201d a Reddit user wrote, referring to the Curly Girl Method of using just conditioner and gel. (CGM was developed by Lorraine Massey, a DevaCurl founder, who left the company in 2013.) For the products not just to fail customers but also to potentially harm them felt akin to betrayal.The company, which grew out of the success of the SoHo specialty curl salon DevaChan, and whose products were name-dropped on \u201cBroad City,\u201d has established a website called Facts About DevaCurl. There are details of various tests performed and frequently asked questions, including whether DevaCurl is considering a recall. Answer: No.\u201cNothing is more important to us than the health of our DevaCurl community,\u201d Jennifer Smith, DevaCurl\u2019s research and development manager, wrote in an emailed statement. She added that based on rigorous testing and consultation with medical professionals, scientists and stylists, \u201cwe can conclusively say that our products are safe.\u201dThe company has also offered no-questions-asked refunds, Ms. Smith said. Neither Sephora nor Ulta, both of which carry the products, have immediate plans to remove them.\u201cWe are in close communication with the brand as they continue to update the beauty community on the safety and effectiveness of their products,\u201d Sephora said in an emailed statement. A statement from Ulta also said the company was continuing \u201cto work closely with DevaCurl to understand the issues some users may have experienced.\u201dFact-Checking the \u2018Facts\u2019The complaints recall those made against Wen Hair Care, products by the celebrity stylist Chaz Dean, in 2016, when hundreds of people joined a class-action lawsuit claiming that the company\u2019s sulfate-free cleansing conditioners caused hair loss and scalp irritation. (The Food and Drug Administration also investigated, after receiving 127 complaints, the most ever received for a conditioning product.) Wen did not recall its products and denied the allegations but settled the suit for $26.25 million.It\u2019s still not clear what caused the Deva-Curl problem. On its \u201cfacts\u201d website, DevaCurl states: \u201cOur products do not cause hair loss\u201d \u2014 that phrase in bold italic \u2014 \u201cbecause they do not penetrate the scalp or affect the hair bulb. Hair loss is often related to excessive scalp irritation, medical conditions and other stressors.\u201dAsked by The New York Times to fact-check this statement, two doctors \u2014 not affiliated with either DevaCurl or the lawsuit \u2014 refuted it. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying Amazon does not directly influence customers\u2019 holiday spirit because their delivery people do not fully enter buyers\u2019 homes,\u201d said Carlos Wesley, a hair restoration surgeon in Manhattan.Dr. Wesley, who also reviewed the list of some 200 ingredients posted on the website, said that some of them, including aminomethyl propanol, a product stabilizer, do penetrate the skin\u2019s uppermost layers. And depending on where a hair is in the growing cycle, it can be open or closed to product penetration, making it likely that some cleanser or cream has infiltrated the stem cell region of the follicle, Dr. Wesley said.Maryanne Senna, a dermatologist and the director of the Hair Academic Innovative Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said that products don\u2019t need to reach the hair bulb \u2014 the onion-shaped swelling you see if you pull a hair out by the root \u2014 to cause hair loss. The superficial inflammation that products may cause can contribute to hair loss and increased breakage.Inflammation around the follicle can also cause it to harden, affecting hair texture and, in the case of curly hair, curl pattern. What ingredient, specifically, may be causing the irritation? There are multiple possibilities, both doctors and a cosmetic chemist said after reviewing the ingredient list.Dr. Senna and Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist and founder of TheBeautyBrains.com, a site where scientists examine product ingredients and industry claims, separately suggested that fragrance could be to blame.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge sensitizer,\u201d said Dr. Senna, who also teaches at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wesley pointed to a solvent called propylene glycol, which causes redness, and said that with such a lengthy list of ingredients, some instances of scalp sensitivity \u201care not surprising.\u201dAsked about these scientists\u2019 assessments, DevaCurl responded with a statement from Ms. Smith reiterating that DevaCurl\u2019s products \u201cdo not penetrate the scalp or affect the hair bulb.\u201d Hair loss, she added, \u201ccan result from many unrelated factors and there is zero evidence that our products are contributing to that process.\u201dThe First Line of DefenseWhere does all this leave you when choosing a hair product? Practically needing a degree in cosmetic chemistry, unfortunately.Both doctors avoided naming brands, saying it was impossible to keep up with the sheer number of products and their ever-changing formulations.Dr. Wesley recommends washing the scalp at least three times a week to remove sebum, which contains cortisol and DHT, both hormones that contribute to shedding and gradual hair loss. Plain old water \u2014 no label reading required there \u2014 can work perfectly fine for the task, he said.When you\u2019re buying products, choose ones that specifically state they\u2019re fragrance-free. Companies are not required to detail ingredients used for fragrance, and many are irritants, Dr. Senna said.Depending on how concerned you are, you may also want to avoid any of the other ingredients already called out above, as well as a preservative called methylisothiazolinone (MI) and its cousin methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI), which are sometimes blended. MI had the dubious honor of being named the American Contact Dermatitis Society\u2019s Allergen of the Year in 2013.As for Ms. Mero and Ms. Malik, both are struggling to replace their former favorite products. \u201cIt sucks having to basically date again after the worst breakup of my life,\u201d Ms. Mero said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this DevaCurl thing felt like.\u201d"}, null, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/style/tiktok-ban-us-users-influencers-taylor-lorenz.html", "title": "What if the U.S. Bans TikTok?", "summary": "Gen Z and millennial users have found community on the app, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic.

(Ms. Zoila, who is white, had secured a permit for the protest, but was looking for someone from the Black community to lead it. Ms. Day sent her a message.) Ms. Day thought \u201csomething like 50 people would show up.\u201d There were thousands, stretching for miles.In Chicago, Shayla Turner, 18, spent part of her high school graduation week campaigning to remove police from inside Chicago\u2019s public schools. She has been on the front lines of the city\u2019s protests and cleanup efforts, where she saw people tear gassed for the first time. It has not deterred her (though it has worried her mother).And from her bedroom in St. Louis, where she lives with her parents while on break from college, Brianna Chandler, 19, was using social media to organize a teach-in for local high school and college students to learn about racial justice. Two older activists called in, including Cori Bush, who is running for Congress; another girl, part of a local arts troupe, read a poem about police brutality.\u201cI think that educating people is essential to movement building,\u201d said Ms. Chandler, who is also active in the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate justice organization.Teen girls have long been at the forefront of social progress. Think Malala Yousafzai, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez or Greta Thunberg.So have Black women. It was three Black women \u2014 Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi \u2014 who founded the Black Lives Matter organization. Black women led early movements for voting rights and have organized some of the most successful campaigns for civil rights.These teenagers are stepping up to continue that legacy.By Zoom from their homes (and in a series of follow-ups), The New York Times spoke with Ms. Thomas, Ms. Day, Ms. Turner and Ms. Chandler about racial justice, youth activism and what they hope for the future.\u273fImageZee Thomas, 15, with her co-organizers in Nashville. From left (top row): Ms. Thomas, Nya Collins, Emma Rose Smith, Mikayla Smith. Bottom: Kennedy Green, left, and Jade Fuller.Credit...Yasmine Malone for The New York TimesZee and Tiana, neither of you had ever led a protest before. What propelled you?Zee, 15: It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve never been to a protest before \u2014 like, ever. This is my first protest and probably not my only one, but being that I didn\u2019t have the experience, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I got inspired by what people were doing all across America, but there was no protest in Nashville at the time. I was like, why isn\u2019t Tennessee doing anything? Why are they silent?So I was like, enough is enough. We\u2019re going to do something. I got on social media. Social media was like my best friend when it comes to this. I met my other organizers there. They contacted me on Twitter and Instagram. They were like, can I help? I was like, sure.I was nervous to talk to my mom at first. I said, \u201cMom, if I do this, would you be OK with it?\u201d She didn\u2019t question me, which was really surprising. She was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be behind you every step of the way.\u201d And that\u2019s what really set it off.Tiana, 17: For me, I was never really an activist before. But this movement lit a fire in me.I live in San Ramon, a suburban town in California, and I\u2019ve grown up around people who didn\u2019t look like me my whole life. And I\u2019ve been constantly trying to fit in. I would stay out of the sun so I wouldn\u2019t tan. I would straighten my hair every day. There\u2019s so many things that I did to try to suppress who I was and what my culture was. And it\u2019s sick now to think of it. I just never felt like myself.But I have always had this, like, boiling thing, this boiling passion in my body to want to make a change in the world. I just never knew what it was. So when Mimi, my co-organizer, commented on an Instagram post about needing a leader for a protest, I DM-ed her. We organized the entire thing in 18 hours, pushing out a single flyer.We bought three cases of water because we thought it was enough. It was like four miles straight of people who were there to support the movement and honestly, most of them weren\u2019t even Black. They were allies. It was so beautiful.I think I found myself through this movement.\u201cI\u2019ve never led a protest before. But this movement lit a fire in me.\u201d \u2014 Tiana Day, 17ImageTiana Day, 17, with her father, Tiayadi Day. She only recently learned that her father had been an activist, too.Credit...James Tensuan for The New York TimesYou are each leading major actions with thousands of people, typically organizing from the bedrooms where you live with your parents. How have your families responded?Shayla, 18: My mom actually found out I was protesting through the newspaper. She was in Walgreens and did a double take because I was on the cover of the The Chicago Tribune. She called me, and I was so scared, because I had lied to her and said that I was going out with my friends that day.She was like, \u201cI remember that day, you lied to my face!\u201d But I had to. She doesn\u2019t really think it\u2019s safe, and she doesn\u2019t want me out there. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m going to be out there and it\u2019s better for me to tell her where I am. It actually brought us closer. We keep having these sentimental moments where she\u2019s just super-proud of me and she\u2019ll start crying.Tiana: My dad is from Richmond, which is a rougher part of the Bay Area. And he worked his butt off \u2014 he worked five jobs at one point \u2014 to make sure that we could live in a house in a nice area. I think he kind of sheltered me, or tried to shelter me, from the hardships of being a Black American.And come to find out, my dad was part of the movement against police brutality after Rodney King. My grandfather was part of the Black Panther movement. I have so much Black history in my life.You never knew about this before?Tiana: Not until two weeks ago! At the protest, I spoke about how I\u2019ve lived in my city for over 15 years and police still racially profile my family. When my dad is driving, they pull him over and run his plates and ask him where he\u2019s going. He says, \u201cHome, like the rest of you.\u201d We all live in this community, and it\u2019s sad to see my Black brothers and sisters discriminated against. We have the right to live here just like you do, but we have to work two times harder to get here.When I finished speaking, my dad was crying. He said, \u201cYou remind me of myself.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d And he goes, \u201cBecause I was an activist at your age.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I was so mad at him! He said, \u201cYeah, your great-grandfather was too.\u201d So now I know, it\u2019s in my blood.\u273fBrianna, you grew up in St. Louis, where you said that your parents put books about Black liberation in your hands as soon as you could read. Do you think that led to your activism as an adult?Brianna, 19: My parents pushed me to become educated about Black history in part because they worked really hard to put me in private schools. And they knew that going to a predominantly white institution would not teach me about my history.When I have gone to marches in the past, my dad has always been there with me. But I\u2019ve never really been what I consider to be \u201con the front lines.\u201d Most of what I do is online. So when I realized that I wouldn\u2019t be able to actually go anywhere to protests, due to Covid and safety concerns, I just kind of sat down and typed out how I was feeling.I posted, and then I kept thinking and writing and posting and it grew from there. What I call \u201cconsciousness raising,\u201d because I think that educating people is essential to movement building. There are a lot of different parts of a movement.Shayla, you were part of a youth climate strike last year, where you gave a speech in front of thousands. You also said you had a fear of public speaking. How did you overcome that?Shayla: I\u2019ve always been really outspoken, but also really introverted. But my junior year, there was a youth climate strike and I just felt like I had to speak out. I go to a predominantly Black and Brown school on the Southwest side of Chicago, and there were three teachers who really inspired me to use my voice. They stayed late with me and practiced my speech over and over. The day before, I vomited three times because I was so nervous.But I did it, and I did it damn well. I think I just had a choice to either keep my voice in or speak out and continue. And right after my speech, I was like, \u201cSo when\u2019s the next one? I\u2019m here.\u201dBrianna: I just want to shout out Shayla, because climate justice is racial justice. Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t just about eliminating police brutality. It\u2019s about dismantling all systems that endanger Black people.ImageShayla Turner, 18, in Chicago.Credit...Carlos Ortiz for The New York Times\u2018I feel like I\u2019ve always had the drive, but until recently, I was too afraid to speak out.\u2019 \u2014 Shayla Turner, 18\u273fWhat\u2019s something about your generation that people get wrong?Brianna: That our anger is not valid, that we don\u2019t have a reason to be angry, that we don\u2019t have a reason to riot. You know, there is that super-popular Malcolm X quote: \u201cThe most disrespected person in America is the Black woman.\u201dIt\u2019s the idea that Black women have to say things nicely, or they have to say things using standard English, or that they\u2019re ignorant if they speak using African-American vernacular English. I think what the world gets wrong is that the anger of Black women isn\u2019t valid \u2014 and it is. It\u2019s more valid than I think any white person can comprehend.Zee: I also want people to know that we\u2019re not strong all the time. We\u2019re allowed to be weak. We are teenagers, we\u2019re young women, and we\u2019re allowed to be emotional, especially when we see people of our skin color getting killed.As Black women, we\u2019re often expected to be the higher person. We\u2019re expected to be stronger and more diligent when it comes to our emotions. I think the stereotype about Black women being strong is true. But we\u2019re people just like everybody else, we experience emotions like everybody else.How are you all taking care of yourselves right now?Shayla: I\u2019ve been taking rest days, and sometimes I\u2019ll delete social media for a couple of hours and watch movies or do something that makes me happy. It just gets so exhausting seeing a new name and a new hashtag.Tiana: I try to space out a free day. Like, tomorrow I will have absolutely nothing planned. Yesterday I had absolutely nothing planned. And with all the attention the movement is getting, especially on young Black people who are leading these protests, I think it\u2019s important we turn certain opportunities down because you can\u2019t do everything.Zee: I try to focus on what I\u2019m doing at the moment and just live in it. And that\u2019s how my mental health has improved within these past few days. Because of course, every time you go on social media there\u2019s always something happening. Like, you get burned out from hearing that news. You get burned out because that\u2019s the life we have to live.Mental health in the Black community isn\u2019t taken very seriously. And a lot of our parents, or our parents\u2019 parents, have mental health problems and that goes on to the future generations without any help. So I feel like, as far as mental health right now, you have to just live in the moment. Because personally, if I think about the future, that just makes me more anxious.When\u2019s the last time you did something to feel like a teen?Zee: Oh gosh. I don\u2019t even know! That\u2019s kind of sad, isn\u2019t it?Brianna: I think the most normal thing I do is just watch TV. Like stuff about vampires and werewolves, stuff that\u2019s not based on reality, to help me de-stress.\u273fWhere do you want to see the movement go from here?Shayla: I want to see an entire revolution led by youth. I feel like we are definitely capable of that. We have the power and we have the voices.Why do you think we are seeing so many young women leading?Zee: Because we are tired. Our generation had to grow up too quickly in order to make sure our younger siblings and even our kids will grow up in a world where we are equal and free to be who we are regardless of skin color or gender identity or sexuality.\u2018I think that educating people is essential to movement building.\u2019 \u2014 Brianna Chandler, 19ImageBrianna Chandler, 19, in Olivette, Mo.Credit...Whitney Curtis for The New York TimesDo you think there\u2019s a difference in the way your generation is approaching this movement from those who\u2019ve come before you?Brianna: I will say that sometimes the more popular elder activists are reformist. And I think that my generation is kind of calling for abolition rather than reform. Like, we don\u2019t just want to give police body cameras. We want to get rid of the police because we don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re making anyone safer. We don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re making our neighborhoods better.And that\u2019s not new. Like, Angela Davis has been saying that, many radical Black people of the past have been saying it. I think people are just becoming more aware of it.What gives you hope?Tiana: How many people are sticking up and starting protests.Brianna: Seeing all of the people who are going beyond social media to educate themselves \u2014 donating, reading and having conversations with their friends and family.Shayla: Chicago youth give me hope. Everyone in my close friend group is involved within this movement, and many others. That\u2019s kind of normal for kids here, because everyone cares.Zee: After the protest, I really couldn\u2019t sleep at all. I was on Twitter, as usual. And there was this one tweet from a mother. And I remember it so clearly, because I started crying. She said, \u201cI\u2019m happy that my daughter will grow up in a world that these young girls will change.\u201dAnd that\u2019s a moment where I felt really powerful, because my main goal, as a person and as an upcoming activist, is to make sure that people know that things will change.

Shane Dawson, 31, and Jeffree Star, 34, two of the biggest stars on the platform, faced renewed backlash after allegations of racism, the sexualization of minors and back-stabbing swirled. The public call-out has resulted in an unfollow campaign that has led to both losing hundreds of thousands of followers.Mr. Dawson and Mr. Star have been two of the most powerful and influential YouTubers for nearly 10 years. Mr. Star is also the C.E.O. of Jeffree Star Cosmetics, a popular makeup brand, which he started in 2014.Until recently, Mr. Dawson was a beloved creator who has been called the \u201cking of YouTube.\u201d He\u2019s been a regular on the platform since 2008 and is connected and friendly with many other top YouTubers. Last year, he produced a docuseries on Mr. Star, which has nearly 150 million views; the two also released a makeup palette together.But offensive statements and videos that Mr. Star and Mr. Dawson posted in previous years are getting renewed attention.Mr. Dawson has racked up billions of views on YouTube, often by engaging in offensive humor. He has posted several videos in blackface, mocked those with disabilities, joked about bestiality, sexualized minors, and once spoke about \u201cfiguratively murdering someone.\u201d On June 26, Mr. Dawson posted a teary apology to his channel, in which he tried to make amends for his past, declaring that he deserved to \u201close everything.\u201dNo sooner had his apology video posted than a clip of him pretending to sexually gratify himself to a photo of Willow Smith, then 11 years old, resurfaced and began to get shared widely. Jaden and Jada Pinkett Smith spoke out against Mr. Dawson immediately. \u201cTo Shane Dawson \u2026 I\u2019m done with the excuses,\u201d Ms. Pinkett Smith, Willow\u2019s mother, tweeted.Here\u2019s more by our reporter Taylor Lorenz:TikTok Users React to Threat to Ban App in U.S.Meet the Original Renegade Dance CreatorTikTok Stars Race to Land Reality TV ShowsMr. Star, a close friend of Mr. Dawson\u2019s, also faced cancellation last week. Like Mr. Dawson, Mr. Star has been a fixture on YouTube since the early days. But while Mr. Dawson cultivated an image of a good-natured friend to all, Mr. Star has been called a YouTube \u201csuper villain\u201d and is considered by many fans to be duplicitous.Beauty insiders have speculated that both Mr. Dawson and Mr. Star played a large behind-the-scenes role in stoking backlash against James Charles, another beauty YouTuber, last year.Mr. Star\u2019s tight hold on the beauty community and broader relevance on YouTube has begun slipping, as has Mr. Dawson\u2019s. In the past few months, several channels that document drama have released investigations into Mr. Star\u2019s past, resurfacing old content in which Mr. Star posed for a brand he was set to start called Lipstick Nazi and supported a fellow music artist, Dahvie Vanity, who was accused of sexual misconduct.Mr. Star also allegedly gathered damning information about fellow YouTube stars to wield over their heads as blackmail.Neither Mr. Star nor Mr. Dawson responded to a request for comment.While many of these incidents have surfaced before, the repeated accusations against the two YouTubers at a time when the broader culture is coming to grips with rampant racism and problematic behavior could lead to permanent changes in the beauty world.Already, Mr. Dawson and Mr. Star are hemorrhaging hundreds of thousands of followers and face a storm of criticism online. Target has removed Mr. Dawson\u2019s books from its shelves, according to Insider. On Tuesday, YouTube announced the company had suspended monetization across all three of Mr. Dawson\u2019s channels.\u201cFor the longest time Jeffree and Shane have been untouchable,\u201d said Will Larkins, a 15-year-old who provides commentary on internet drama and has been documenting these events on his Twitter handle @OhMyGodExposeU. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten away with everything. I think people are finally fed up and realizing that we can\u2019t just keep giving people like this a platform.\u201dOutside of Mr. Star and Mr. Dawson, fans have begun to look at an entire generation of millennial influencers in a new light. Jenna Marbles, another YouTuber who had been on the site for a decade, recently quit after backlash to an old video in which she appeared in blackface.The YouTubers David Dobrik and Liza Koshy have also faced sharp criticism for old videos, in which they imitated the Japanese language. \u201cI hope one day people can learn and change and grow before they make millions of dollars doing black face,\u201d Akilah Hughes, a YouTuber, tweeted on June 26. \u201cMy tears are reserved for all the black people who will never even attempt to have a YouTube career because they don\u2019t want to be subjected to racism all day every day as a living.\u201dAs many older white millennial beauty influencers lose relevance, a newer, more diverse crop of creators is stepping in. \u201cYou have YouTubers like Raw Beauty Kristi, Jackie Aina, Nyma Tang, who are not problematic, and that\u2019s just to name a few,\u201d said Ashlye Kyle, 35, who runs a YouTube drama channel focused on the beauty world. \u201cI think that they\u2019re going to gain more influence.\u201dEven if Mr. Dawson and Mr. Star battle their way through this backlash, Ms. Kyle and others in the YouTube beauty world believe they\u2019ll never regain the influence they had. \u201cDo I feel like Jeffree will always have his stans and his next makeup launch will sell out?\u201d Ms. Kyle said. \u201cAbsolutely. And will Shane\u2019s next docuseries still get millions of views? Yes, I do. But the beauty community itself is finally seeing their true colors.\u201dWill Larkins said: \u201cThis pyramid system where Shane and Jeffree are kings and everyone else is below them is over.\u201dHe added that \u201cthe next generation of beauty influencers, it\u2019s going to be about artistry and not just drama. People are realizing we need more representation of people of color, Asians and every minority. The beauty world is a place to express yourself. The younger generation understands that better than the older beauty gurus.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/at-home/coronavirus-DIY-pedicure.html", "title": "Give Yourself the Perfect Summer Pedicure", "summary": "Getting your feet sandal-ready can be done at home.

They\u2019ll be \u201ccontaminated with nail dust and fungus, and that lives on the nail file,\u201d she explained, so you shouldn\u2019t hold on to them.Also grab cotton balls and nail polish remover to get rid of remnants of pedicures past. And finally, you\u2019ll need your base, color and top coat within reach.Work in a well-lit area (natural light is best). \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a bright light in your apartment, wear a headlamp,\u201d said Dr. Archer, who often employs this technique both in her home and her office.Landscape your nails.Spray your feet with rubbing alcohol, focusing on the nail and cuticle. \u201cSo, if something does happen and you do nick yourself you\u2019re not going to get infected,\u201d Dr. Archer said. Then, pat them dry.Next, cut your toenails for length. No matter your preferred nail shape, experts agree you should always cut straight across to avoid ingrown nails. (If you do get an ingrown toe nail, make an appointment with a doctor. \u201cDon\u2019t go diving for it,\u201d Dr. Archer said.)Then use a file to gently shape the sides of your nail, she said, getting rid of any sharp corners, by following the lunula, the lighter colored half moon shape at the nail base. Dr. Archer recommends leaving the cuticle cutting to professionals, too. Instead, gently push back the cuticle with a metal cuticle pusher.Ditch your dead skin.Some nail salons buff out calluses after feet have had a good soak. But Margaret Dabbs, a foot care specialist in London who has a line of products in her name, said to avoid wetting the skin first.\u201cYou\u2019re going to mask the area that needs to be treated, and you\u2019re not going to see the dry skin, the cracks in the skin or the hard skin,\u201d Ms. Dabbs explained. ImageCheci Pro Nickel Foot FileSo, use your foot file before you soak your feet. Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times, recommends the Checi Pro Nickel Foot File ($26), which is metal and can be sanitized, or the Gehwol Wooden Pedicure file ($25). Or Ms. Dabbs\u2019s foot care line has a stainless steel foot file with replaceable filing pads ($44). Rub the heel and balls of the feet, which are typically the most callused parts, with your dry foot file in a back and forth motion. The soft parts of the skin, those in between the toes and the arch of your foot, will be taken care of by an exfoliating scrub.Remember: Leaving some calluses on your foot is beneficial and protective, but too much callus can lead to gait changes and if they rip open, infection. To avoid these complications, it\u2019s best to dry file your clean feet once a week. If you have lost sensation in your feet, Dr. Archer and Ms. Dabbs both recommend forgoing the foot file completely.Now, soak your feet.You\u2019ve made it to the relaxing part. Both Dr. Archer and Ms. Dabbs suggest using Epsom salts, which can relax the muscles in your feet; Dr. Archer recommends adding drops of essential oils, like tea tree, for an aromatherapy experience. Ms. Dabbs likes rinsing fresh mint leaves with cold water and tossing them into a basin for some cooling relief on a hot day.Rub your wet feet with an exfoliating scrub to remove any lingering dead skin. Then, pat dry and moisturize with a thicker cream, like L\u2019Occitane en Provence\u2019s Shea Butter Foot Cream ($29). If you\u2019re looking for lower-cost and more natural options, Dr. Archer recommends coconut oil, olive oil or shea butter. You could also try a foot mask (an actual thing!): Gina Edwards, a celebrity nail stylist, recommends the one from KISS ($2.99), which you leave on for at least 15 minutes.Finally, polish your nails.Get into position: You might want to elevate your feet on a stool or rest them on a windowsill so you can reach them better. If you don\u2019t have a toe separator, which does exactly what it sounds like and is available for a low-cost at most drugstores, Ms. Edwards recommends cutting makeup wedges and placing them between your toes, as they are sturdier than cotton balls or paper towels. Be sure to remove any oil or moisturizer residue from your toenails with nail polish remover.ImageJinsoon Hyper RepairCredit...JinsoonImageEssie good to go top coatCredit...EssieStart by applying a base coat, which smooths the nails so that your polish sticks better"}, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/fashion/weddings/michelle-wikum-walker-williams.html", "title": "Michelle Wikum, Walker Williams", "summary": "", "authors": "By Nina Reyes", "text": "Michelle Joy Wikum and Walker Samuel Williams were married June 13 at the home of the bride\u2019s parents in Santa Ana, Calif.

I\u2019m grateful for what this \u2014 and my son\u2019s autism \u2014 has taught me.", "authors": "By Paige Martin Reynolds", "text": "A tiny white heart marks a five-second video on my phone as beloved, one in which my boy (age 6 at the time) proudly displays a pale pink cross-body purse. He twists his torso as he flirts with the camera, asking, \u201cHey girl, do you like my new purrrrrrse?\u201dWhen I get a new purse, I know it will be the first thing my son notices when he sees me. His congratulatory enthusiasm (\u201cMama, your new purse is so pretty!\u201d) is followed by a dimply smile and a smooth inquiry about the previous handbag (\u201cSo, can I have your old purse?\u201d). And it\u2019s not just about purses but bags of all sorts: Max follows this same script whenever his father upgrades his briefcase or his sister brings home a new backpack.One day the movie \u201cInside Out\u201d was on as he played, and he paused to watch the moment when the main character secretly takes money from her mother\u2019s purse so she can run away.\u201cIf I was in that movie,\u201d he said, \u201cI would take the whole purse.\u201dYes, you would, buddy. This has been predictable since the little charmer was 3, when he began proclaiming his passion for baggage with an almost regal splendor and sovereignty.His Majesty required bags, and bags he would have \u2014 diaper bags, suitcases, reusable grocery bags and more \u2014 which are packed, unpacked, repacked and toted from one location to another each day. Max\u2019s bags have lived all over our house, in our cars, offices and every other space the boy occupies. Even now, at 9, Max often lets out a panicked, \u201cHold on just a minute!\u201d when it\u2019s time to leave so he can frantically pack a bag.[Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.]Max\u2019s autism diagnosis three years ago gave me an unspeakable sense of relief. When a friend asked me later that day how I was feeling, I could only describe it in this way: \u201cI feel empty and full at the same time.\u201dAfter years of being dismissed as hysterical and overprotective, I welcomed the diagnosis as overdue validation. To be seen and heard is always humanizing, and as a woman in the world, I have confronted my own invisibility more times than I wish to recall. The diagnosis, in my mind, represented progress.It\u2019s a strange kind of answer that promises only more questions. But my love for my boy has never been in question \u2014 that day I felt as full as ever of gratitude for this child, even as I felt emotionally emptied out on his behalf. This is a paradox that continues. I empty myself for him and love fills me back up in overwhelming waves.Though Max\u2019s bag-stuffing frenzy has slowed (and we understand his neurology better than before), the state of my home, especially during his peak packing years, has reflected the state of my emotional life. The chaos was hard to accept and even harder to explain. Things were never where they belonged, which made the simplest tasks complicated. And no matter how early I tried to get us ready to leave when we had to be somewhere, we seemed destined to be late.The moment of departure has always elicited the same desperate plea from Max \u2014 \u201cHold on just a minute!\u201d \u2014 despite the savviest of strategies (and we\u2019ve tried a lot of them). I spent years feeling frustrated and ashamed, though I knew the domestic disorder wasn\u2019t entirely my fault.And I knew it wasn\u2019t Max\u2019s fault, even with his aggressive bag-packing agenda. He would pick up a utensil here and a knickknack there until he had gathered an impressive collection of items (which would then be missing for as long as it took us to find them). Watching him pack was like seeing an artist in the magical moment of inspiration, rapturous in his focus, relentless in his resolve.We lived among bags filled with random contents \u2014 from paperwork to produce, jewelry to juice boxes, coasters to coins \u2014 stashed around the house like little loads of hidden treasure. Max\u2019s bags ingested the bits of our daily lives, shook them up, then spat them back out in the inevitable mess I was forever failing to clean up.After he suffered a prolonged seizure at age 5 \u2014 he was unresponsive for almost an hour and ended up in ICU \u2014 the neurologist, MRI results in hand, told us about Max\u2019s \u201cmigration abnormalities.\u201d To paraphrase the doctor\u2019s explanation, when our boy was just a wee one in my womb and his brain began forming, some neuro-stuff didn\u2019t make it to its intended home.As I understand it, when a brain develops, neurons are meant to travel from where they start to where they should stay. This great migration is chemically complex, and sometimes neurons don\u2019t follow it. When neurons don\u2019t migrate to the place in the brain where they were meant to, the result is \u201cmigration abnormalities.\u201dThis is what\u2019s been happening all over my house: migration abnormalities. I still encounter things daily that don\u2019t end up where they were meant to be. In part, this is mundane and ordinary. After all, nobody lives in a space that is perpetually clean.But there is a kind of wildness and whimsy to our home\u2019s untidiness, an unpredictability that mirrors the neurological difference produced by Max\u2019s migration abnormalities. Spatula in the bathroom? Bewildering. Four backpacks, two shoe boxes and an old purse stacked in my study, full of toys and trifles and important documents? Overwhelming.Last autumn when my best friend visited, she looked at me endearingly and said, \u201cWhy are there pennies everywhere?\u201dI don\u2019t know why, my friend, but I do know who.Pennies by the pound: atop shelves, between cushions, inside containers, beneath furniture. It\u2019s strange but delightfully so.One of Max\u2019s great gifts to us is this insight. To have our house mirror his mind. Although I will never be able to see the world through his eyes, I feel like our home\u2019s \u201cmigration abnormalities\u201d give me a glimpse into my boy\u2019s brain. And with that glimpse comes the glimmer of understanding.When Max was a few days old, he had jaundice. The doctor told me to breastfeed every two hours while drinking as much water as possible. Already disoriented from having given birth, I felt exhilarated and exhausted, delighted and depleted \u2014 that is, empty and full at the same time.And now my purpose was to empty myself further to fill this new human. From the outside, I imagine my assignment looked pretty cushy. I lounged around in my softest pajamas, nursing, hydrating and watching TV. Switch breasts, switch drinks, switch shows, stifle sobs, repeat.No doubt I appeared to be soaking up some rest and relaxation with my precious newborn, when in truth, the breastfeeding marathon was one of the most physically demanding things I have ever done.At the follow-up appointment, when I learned that my baby had gained weight as needed, I broke down in quiet tears.\u201cOh, honey,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cThose hormones!\u201dYes, those hormones. Heaven help us, those hormones. But also, something big had happened. Max and I had survived a tough trial together. And that seemed worth a few joyful, tired tears \u2014 hormones or not. That was the beginning of a series of battles my body (and soul) would go through for this boy \u2014 battles that would be invisible from the outside but traumatic and transformative for me on the inside.Max and I did it together. We continue to. Every time we leave a restaurant, make it to the end of a movie or leave Target without a meltdown is a mutual triumph.Perhaps a life-or-death situation sometimes looks like lounging, or heroic success looks like hormonal instability. And maybe my boy\u2019s magnificent mind resembles a messy house. Feats have become commonplace to my family, and despite the misunderstandings they may provoke, we know they are monumental \u2014 whether or not anyone else can see or appreciate it.For months now, as the pandemic has raged, we\u2019ve been cooped up at home, with Max\u2019s routines (that he so relies on) blown to smithereens. Once he begged to drive by his school \u201cto make sure it\u2019s doing OK all alone.\u201d He packs bags that, like us, never seem to go anywhere. Yet we are also all together, and he finds comfort in that.Immense and intense, the range of emotions we experience on any one day is vast. From paralyzing anxiety to unbridled joy. From anger that fuels my advocacy to grief that stuns me into silence. From panic to presence, terror to trust, this experience of love is like none I could have ever imagined.Empty and full at the same time, in the most meaningful ways.Paige Martin Reynolds, who lives in Little Rock, Ark., is a professor of English at the University of Central Arkansas.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.Want more from Modern Love?

I chose \u201claugh\u201d because I was 19 and didn\u2019t think anyone should take life too seriously.

But I still wanted a tattoo.Humor has been my go-to coping mechanism since practically before I could cut my own food. It got my parents\u2019 attention, helped me make friends, defined my exterior personality and gave me a kind of superpower, allowing me to fake an extroverted existence.

That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re too scared to be yourself. I only talk to two of my high school friends now.When I was 21, I studied in Sydney, Australia, for a semester, where the whole experience felt like an extension of the extroverted version of myself that I had mastered. It was a sprint along a path that wasn\u2019t really mine, filled with adventure seeking, bar hopping, beach time, writing a deeply offensive short story in my creative writing class for the sake of laughter and shock (masking any real thoughts or feelings). On that same sprint, I jumped headfirst into a relationship, my first, as the wrong version of me.Then, in the midst of my act, I stumbled into a moment where I didn\u2019t have to pretend. It was at a wildlife sanctuary, of all places. While everyone else was gawking at kangaroos and koalas, I was staring at a caged bird, an emu. It stared at me with its big eyes. And kept staring. I stared back. For a long time. In silence. I could not relieve the silence with a joke or a selfie and felt no need to. I felt clarity for the first time in maybe forever. But I did not know how to make it last.Three years later (two years too late), the girlfriend I met in Australia and I broke up. The ghost of a broken heart wove in and out of my life for a year, teasing me at bars when I had no one to buy a drink for and no one to walk home with, lingering in my phone as I searched my contacts for someone to share my good and bad news with, staring at me in restaurants from the empty seat across the table.Until, slowly, the pain started to fade, and I realized that my broken heart was not actually mine but belonged to the person I had tried to convince myself I was. So I mourned the loss of my false self and celebrated the possibility of a new beginning. I went on new adventures: going to the movies by myself, walking around the city at night, unconcerned with having any social plans. Sitting in cafes alone and reading. The old me, the brokenhearted me, could not tag along as I leaned into the person she never wanted: my introverted and sensitive self.And then I began yearning for a tattoo again, but it was not this realization of a new beginning or my ability to find the light at the end of the heartbreak tunnel, that I wanted to immortalize on my body. So I continued to wait until I knew which version of myself was worth remembering.On my 26th birthday, I found myself alone at a bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It was a special moment because I felt I deserved 20 or so minutes to myself, sipping a beer and observing the crowd without having to engage in pleasantries.I did not start the evening alone, nor did I end it that way. A friend from preschool had come into the city for the night. Two high school friends joined. And others from college and adulthood surrounded me. The love shown by friends is not, from my experience, the suffocating kind. It exists like a weightless hug. But I am not a hugger by nature, so I had to sneak out to a nearby bar to steal some time alone.As I sat by myself, I ignored my friends\u2019 texts and calls. I just needed a moment to re-energize. Was I being rude? Probably. But it was my birthday and I did not owe anything to anyone. I was learning the delicate balance of setting boundaries.And then I learned what kind of company matters.It went something like this. A few months later, I was at a bar in Harlem drinking margaritas with a few friends, including her, a person I knew only through someone else. Just her presence made something click.\u201cI want a tattoo,\u201d I said. I wanted more than a tattoo. I wanted connection.\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d our mutual friend said. \u201cYou\u2019re just bored.\u201dI regretted saying anything.\u201cOf what?\u201d she said.I told her the story of the caged emu. How dumb but beautiful they look. How I had yet to find the calmness I found that day on the other side of the world. I made jokes, trying to lighten the moment, but mostly I was scared that my random thoughts would not be received as I intended them. I actually didn\u2019t know how I intended them; I just wanted someone to understand. A person, unlike an emu, who could speak back to me. And then she did.\u201cThat story actually wasn\u2019t as stupid as I expected it to be,\u201d she said, smiling from across the table. \u201cI say go for it.\u201dWith that, something shifted at the table, in the air, in the city.By the end of the night, I found myself on the subway with her and then, later, at another bar. In between, we sat on a stoop in the West Village as I drew a sketch of an emu. Once, twice, then seven times, until she bluntly said that she couldn\u2019t let me put any of my own drawings on my body.Still riding the wave of this strange, bold feeling, I walked with her to a tattoo shop \u2014 the first one we found open \u2014 and had them pull up a photo of an emu on Google images.\u201cThat one,\u201d I said to the guy. \u201cBut make it cartoonish.\u201dI was surprised by how calmly I said it. He had no questions.She and I waited as he went downstairs and drew up what I thought would be a terrible picture I would never want to have on my body forever. He would reappear with his bad drawing, we would laugh, I would back out and we would part ways, letting this be yet another late-night story of what might have been.\u201cWow, that\u2019s actually really good,\u201d she said when he returned with his drawing. And soon I was sitting on a chair in a downtown basement, letting a stranger draw a bird on my arm in permanent ink.Afterward, sitting with her at the bar, I felt full clarity for only the second time ever. This person stared at me as we talked; she understood me. I stared back. No jokes, no need to disrupt the moment.Two years later, I was staring at the emu on my arm and talking to her about that night as she sat next to me on the couch in the home we share.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I let you go through with that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou looked so calm in the chair. I was freaking out on the inside.\u201dI was never freaking out. Not with her there. What started as a symbol of solitude that I found in the Australian desert is now a symbol of the best company and conversations I\u2019ll ever have.\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d I said.Jimmy Harney is a music publicist in New York City.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.Want more?

My younger brother, Nick, revealed the pain he felt because I hadn\u2019t opposed our extended family\u2019s homophobic comments. Despite my efforts to show my brother solidarity through online activism, I had remained silent when our cousin questioned and judged his sexuality. Nick and I are both adopted from Russia, so we know firsthand that family is not defined by blood but by commitment and love. I was ashamed.

The hospital was so expensive; at home, it\u2019s free. Andrew wheeled me through the halls in his wet suit, slipping, looking like Aquaman, refusing to leave my side. The nurses smiled and laughed.

He didn\u2019t charge me. I\u2019ll never forget it.", "authors": "By Bill Eville", "text": "A few weeks ago, I gave myself a crew cut. I didn\u2019t know how long it would be before I could visit a barber and figured I might as well do it myself.I took my electric clippers into the backyard of our house on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where we live year-round. It didn\u2019t take long, a few passes around my head as the hair piled up on the grass. Afterward, I gathered the clumps and placed them at the edge of the yard near the bird feeder as an offering of nesting material.It felt good to rub my hand on my nubby scalp. As a boy I liked to get crew cuts during wrestling season; they made me feel tough and focused. My new crew cut helped me feel that way again, which is good, because on so many days during this pandemic I feel like I want to crawl under the bed and hide.I am also sad about my new look.Not because my 12-year-old daughter cried out in shock, telling me I looked old and bald. Not because my teenage son told me my ears were massive and that I looked like an elf. No, I felt bad because I had shaved off a special haircut, one I have enjoyed once a year, every year, for the last decade.In February, before the pandemic, I traveled to Boston for a conference and also paid my annual visit to a fancy salon on Newbury Street, where I sat at Elie Ferzli\u2019s station.[Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.]Elie and I have known each other for a decade but see each other just once a year, so in total we have spent less than an hour a day together for 10 days. We do not correspond in between, and yet I count him as a dear friend. I believe he feels the same way about me.I met Elie when my wife, Cathlin, was undergoing treatment for breast cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital. She had begun chemotherapy and soon her hair would fall out. Her team at the hospital had sent us to a woman named Pat who owns a salon on Newbury Street that specializes in making wigs, both for cancer patients and the transgender community.When we arrived that evening, Pat met us at the front desk and led us past the rows of busy stylists. As we made our way to the back, I was struck by how we were facing a life and death diagnosis while all these other people were seemingly enjoying normal lives of weekends and joy.I cried often in those days, sometimes quietly, sniffling to myself, and other times explosively, the full force of what our lives had become catching me unaware like a sneeze. Sitting with Pat and Cathlin, talking about wigs and baldness, was one of the times I lost it. Excusing myself, I dashed from the room, planning to walk the streets until my tears had subsided.But as I walked past the rows of beautiful people, I saw a man standing beside an empty chair. He smiled and motioned me to sit. Without thinking, I did.We didn\u2019t talk much. Elie cut and I wept. And he did not charge me.A few weeks later, Cathlin\u2019s hair fell out. We thought it would be gradual, giving us time to adapt, but cancer, we learned, is not so orderly. It is chaos of a different kind, filled with confusion and too much time to think about worst-case scenarios.Cathlin is a minister, so of course her hair fell out on a Sunday morning just before church. A neighbor shaved her head to even out the clumps, and an hour later Cathlin preached a sermon about delivering herself into a fire of love in order to come out the other side, forever changed but somehow stronger.I did a lot of push-ups in those days, outside in the dark of night. Something about gripping the cold earth with my hands felt comforting. Chemotherapy was followed by a double mastectomy and then months of radiation. And then, finally, a cancer-free diagnosis.At first Cathlin returned to Boston twice a year for checkups and then once a year, which she continues to this day. The trips no longer fill us with dread, at least not the heavy type that turns a normally busy and loud family into a quiet one where even our children would press pause on their exuberance as they waited for their mother to return from Mass General with news. Now, so many years and checkups later, it is merely part of our routine.On some level I envy Cathlin and her ability to stay in touch with the cancer team who became our friends and are also reminders of the positive side of those dark days. Being a caregiver to my wife and our children, who were so young then, gave me my first glimpse of becoming the man I had always hoped to be.But while my wife gets to see her oncologist and the nursing staff, I have Elie. Each time I sit in his chair, we check in with each other, which for the first few years mostly meant Elie asking me how Cathlin was doing. Then one year, when I called for my annual appointment, I was told Elie would be out for several months. The receptionist couldn\u2019t tell me why. It would be another year before he could tell me his story.In June of that year, he learned he had multiple myeloma, a disease that enters the bloodstream and bone marrow. After chemotherapy and stem cell treatments, he had to protect his immune system by staying in isolation for four months, unable to walk the streets or even hug his wife or son.He told me this the next year while I sat in his salon chair, looking at him in the mirror before me. He was healthy again, bent over my hair and moving about with ease. Around us, customers and their stylists carried on their own conversations, the hum of voices mixing with the sounds of scissors and blow dryers.The years piled up, and as our children grew, Elie and I shifted from conversations about preschool to grammar school to high school. We grew beards and shaved them off. My hair began to thin, and I worried about going bald, less out of vanity than fear of missing my annual visit with Elie.I brought Cathlin to meet him and then the children. When he met our daughter, whose nickname is Pickle, Elie held out his hand and said, \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Cucumber.\u201dIn February, when I sat down in his chair, we started by checking on each other\u2019s health. I told him Cathlin was doing great, but when I asked him if he was still fine, he said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s define fine.\u201dElie told me his cancer had returned but the doctors were keeping it at bay with twice a week chemo.I looked at him, incredulous. He seemed as energetic as ever. \u201cHow are you still working?\u201d I said. \u201cWhen Cathlin had chemo, she would lie in bed for days.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel the effects,\u201d he said. \u201cNever have. After treatments, I go play volleyball.\u201dElie kept talking and cutting that cold February day, telling me about the particulars of his disease, which would remain in his body until new drugs were discovered. He could only get one more bone marrow transplant, but the doctors were saving that heavy artillery for later. For now, it was chemo and volleyball, a bizarre combination, but one that worked for him.\u201cEnough about this,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s make your hair smile.\u201dAnd we fell quiet, just the clipping of scissors as I watched him from my perch. Cathlin may have her oncology team, but I have Elie to remind me of those days, both the bad and the good. I remembered pushing my wife in a wheelchair through the hospital. She was bald and pale and weak as I led her to the elevator for surgery. People turned their heads and I could almost hear them thinking, \u201cThere goes someone in worse shape than me.\u201dYet it was a golden time, too, filled with fear and uncertainty but also beauty, when trivialities evaporated, leaving only love behind.After the pandemic hit, I called Elie for the first time in our long friendship. He reassured me that he was fine and able to still do his chemo treatments through a separate hospital entrance. We talked a little longer, and I told him about my self-administered, backyard crew cut.\u201cI bet you look handsome,\u201d he said.I don\u2019t, but it was nice to hear.Bill Eville is the managing editor of the Vineyard Gazette on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.Want more?

She lives with her father and her younger sister, Annie, in Wilmslow, England, a town outside Manchester. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a bulb-lit dressing table and a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading \u201cYou\u2019ve Got This\u201d on her bed. Mia\u2019s interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends and during vacation). Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.How often do you shop?I browse every single day \u2014 at least once \u2014 on the Pretty Little Thing phone app. It\u2019s my favorite, and I don\u2019t look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. My current favorite is Molly-Mae Hague, a star from the 2019 series of \u201cLove Island.\u201d She recently created an exclusive clothing range for PLT, which makes me like the brand even more. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don\u2019t really go to bricks-and-mortar stores. If I do, I go to Primark. Sometimes H&M. Maybe once a month, probably less.What kind of an event needs a new look?It could literally just be a meal. Or a house party, or a friend\u2019s birthday. It could also be school, where we have a dress code but not a uniform.Why is Pretty Little Thing your favorite fashion brand?I pay \u00a38.99 as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now \u2014 they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I don\u2019t buy from places like Boohoo.com or Missguided as I\u2019d have to pay for delivery, which would be a waste of money. I buy something at least once a week, and my basket value can be anywhere from \u00a35.99 up. Once it was \u00a3230. Last week I bought 11 items and sent back three. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.How many pieces of clothing do you think you\u2019ve bought in 2019?Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I\u2019ve kept.ImagePretty Little Thing is Mia\u2019s favorite shopping app; she says she looks at it every single day.Credit...Rosie Matheson for The New York TimesWhat is your favorite piece that you\u2019ve bought, and how many times have you worn it?The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost \u00a32.50. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. It cost \u00a312.50 from the PLT Shape collection, which is for people like me who have an hourglass figure. I\u2019ve worn it out three times, which is a lot for me. Normally I just wear a dress once.Why only once?Because I\u2019ll normally be in photos when I\u2019m wearing it that are then posted on social media. I wouldn\u2019t really want someone seeing me in a dress more than once. People might think I didn\u2019t have style if I wore the same thing over and over. Style is about changing for whatever the situation you are in and for different events.When do clothes become old for you?Well, things like leggings that you just wear in private around the house you can keep for years. Dresses, when you\u2019ve worn them: twice.Is price important?Of course. If I\u2019m only going to wear something once or twice, I\u2019m going to want to buy the cheapest possible.What else do you look for?Social media is a big consideration. I\u2019m on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out, first in my bedroom and post them online, and then always with friends or my boyfriend, Will, when I\u2019m at the party. More people will see an outfit online than they probably will in real life. I\u2019m on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.For IRL, if I see an item I like, normally I\u2019ll search for it on Depop before I buy it so I can see what a real person rather than a model looks like in it. People buy and sell fashion so quickly, I can usually find even the newest things on there. Most of my friends do that too.ImageMia snaps a selfie while dressing: \u201cI take selfies for social media every single time I go out,\u201d she says, \u201cfirst in my bedroom and post them online, and then always with friends or my boyfriend.\u201dCredit...Rosie Matheson for The New York TimesWhat constitutes a more special purchase for you?An Oh Polly! dress. I buy them for about \u00a320 from Depop, though new they cost about \u00a340 to \u00a360. Those dresses I keep \u2014 I have three of them. Teenagers don\u2019t mind buying secondhand clothes like some older people do: You can get good looks at a cheaper price, or directly swap one dress for another online. I tend to sell lots of the clothes I don\u2019t want in big batches on Depop. It gives me the money to buy new things. I also sometimes take big bags to consignment stores in town, where they give you a bit of money for your clothes depending on how much you bring in.Do you ever think about where those clothes go once you\u2019ve given or thrown them away?No.Do you ever look at where your clothes are made?Yes. I\u2019ve noticed quite a few are made in England, which shocked me. I thought they\u2019d all be made in countries like China, India and Bangladesh. Also, we have been learning a bit in Sociology about how our clothes are made and the working conditions for people who make them. In some countries I know they don\u2019t get very good wages. It\u2019s part of globalization. I wouldn\u2019t talk about it with my friends casually, but we do talk about it in the classroom.What do you think of sustainable fashion?It came on my radar three months ago, I\u2019d say. I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I\u2019m honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less?ImageAndrea Vargas, an 18-year-old from Farmingdale, New York, gets ready to go out in her room at home. \u201cIf I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures I try not to take a picture again in it,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to repeat.\u201dCredit...Krista Schlueter for The New York Times\u2018I Don\u2019t Like to Repeat\u2019By Taylor LorenzAndrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites like Pretty Little Thing and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M and Forever 21, where she can flip through the racks and, occasionally, find gems.\u201cI go shopping when the season sales are on,\u201d she said one Saturday night at her family\u2019s home in Farmingdale, N.Y. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends: getting dinner, maybe going to a party or a concert. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang\u2019s with three girlfriends. Her room is small, with wood floors and inspirational quotes in photo frames on her pale yellow walls. A Billie Eilish poster hangs opposite her bed. A guitar she made out of an old skateboard sits in a corner.Scanning the clothes in her room, she began talking about how she got them. \u201cThe back-to-school sales, the fall sales, the summer sales,\u201d she said. \u201cI love sales.\u201dHer absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket from Forever 21. She wears it relentlessly when the weather is right. \u201cIt\u2019s just so cute,\u201d Ms. Vargas said. \u201cI feel like it dresses up an outfit.\u201dMs. Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny. But, she said, \u201cI feel like there\u2019s no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. I personally feel like if the quality of the shirt doesn\u2019t match the price, it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to buy it. If a jean jacket costs $60 and I can find it for $20, I\u2019m going to buy it for $20. Especially since I\u2019m in college, I need to buy all these books.\u201dImageThe red plush jacket is Andrea\u2019s favorite piece of clothing, and is from Forever 21.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just so cute,\u201d Andrea says. \u201cI feel like it dresses up an outfit.\u201dCredit...Krista Schlueter for The New York TimesMs. Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces. \u201cI would say the majority of it is shirts,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to be graphic tees. I like a little quote on my shirt here and there. I have yet to buy new jeans. I like a lot of ripped jeans. I rarely buy shoes.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn\u2019t feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she\u2019s done wearing something, it can have a second life. \u201cMy mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don\u2019t have a lot.

She tutors students on weekdays and works a retail job on weekends. When she has time off, she and her friends like to dress up and hit the festival circuit. On a recent evening, after spending the previous day dancing to EDM, she and her friend Helena Marshall got ready in her bedroom for a more relaxing dinner.We\u2019re not influencers \u2014 but \u2026 When I\u2019m dressing to go out, I\u2019m dressing to be seen, which is weird to say because we\u2019re not influencers. It sounds shallow, but I think in the back of your head you\u2019re like: I probably should avoid wearing the same outfit twice.At the end of the day, I prioritize the look versus the practicality. And that\u2019s so unbelievable.Working to be cuteMy friend yesterday at this festival had a really cute Tiger Mist top with hearts all over it, but it had off-the-shoulder sleeves. I felt so bad for her the whole day, because she couldn\u2019t put her arms up. But she got cute photos, so it was fine. I know when you put something up on Instagram and it does well, you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, that was a good choice on my behalf.\u201d I love it when people message, \u201cWhere did you get that from?\u201d You know you\u2019ve found something people can\u2019t easily find.Staying relatableI think about what I\u2019m going to post for a decent amount of time. It\u2019s a very curated version of your life. You want to look good in your photo, but have a funny caption so people know you\u2019re down to earth and relatable.That\u2019s why we have private Instagrams, because it gets tiring.

Because I just overthink what I post: Will people get it? Are people actually going to laugh at that?Sometimes I\u2019ll get a weird feeling where I need to get off social media. I know some people delete their Instagram, like just the app. But that\u2019s admitting to yourself that you have a problem.Leaving shops empty-handedI look for clothes at least once a week usually \u2014 either for an occasion, or just as something to do either online or in store. I shop 60 percent online, 40 percent in person. But 75 percent of the time, I\u2019ll go to the shops, have a look around, and not find one thing because I think everything is the same.I\u2019m not afraid to put on something weird. I\u2019m really big into animal print at the moment. Almost to the point where I\u2019ll wear too much of it. I love my snake pants \u2014 and flares. Flares should never go out.Princess Polly and Tiger MistFor basics, 100 percent of my wardrobe is from Kookai. They\u2019re always rotating really nice, classic things. I get a lot of stuff off Revolve, because there are so many different brands. You\u2019ve got things there that you\u2019re not going to see five people wearing once you\u2019re out. From other online brands like Princess Polly, Tiger Mist. Sometimes it\u2019s overwhelming how much stuff there is online. I could go on for hours.Often, on Instagram, I\u2019ll scroll through the Explore page, and people just tagging outfits. It\u2019s so helpful because you just click onto the account, find the item. That\u2019s how I find the little niche things.Where were these dresses made?If I feel so amazing in something, I\u2019m probably not going to look too hard into the price. But I don\u2019t like investing a lot of money for something you might not wear too much. I like Pretty Little Thing for crazy things for cheap, because they just do interesting little tops or little dresses, clubbing clothes. Do I look at the labels of clothes? Not really. In the back of my head, I assume that I know where the clothes are made: in China.In terms of how much I would spend: average price of a dress, probably about $180 Australian dollars. Jeans, about $150. A good going out top, $50. I do like a nice pair of heels, so I\u2019ve spent like $200 for a pair. But then again I\u2019ve got ones for $50. In my wardrobe now, I\u2019d say I have roughly 200 pieces.ImageSome of Nicole\u2019s clothing and accessories; \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to put on something weird,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really big into animal print at the moment.\u201dCredit...Lisa Maree Williams for The New York TimesCycling the wardrobe overseasI do a big spring clean every year and send boxes of clothes over to my family in the Philippines. One of my cousins has a market stall. So I assumed that maybe my stuff would end up there if they didn\u2019t want to keep it for themselves.I would say 30 percent of my wardrobe would get pulled out. Maybe 80 bits of clothes. It makes a good dent.When I pull it all out and you see a big pile of clothes on your floor, you feel a bit sick. I\u2019m glad that I can send it somewhere and it\u2019s helping at least my family.Supporting sustainability \u2014 or notI want to support sustainable brands. But if it doesn\u2019t work for me and what I\u2019m doing in my lifestyle, I\u2019m going to go with something else instead.Timing is important. For what I wore to the Listen Out festival yesterday, I ordered on Tuesday morning, it came on Wednesday morning: literally in 24 hours. That means so much to me. I\u2019m the least decisive person and the least patient person. When miniature bags were in, I was obsessed with this one from London. You could get your initials on it. But it said it could take 30 days and I was like, never mind. I got a cute one from Mango.You\u2019re pushing it after seven business days.

The mostly online retailer leans on a vast network of celebrities, influencers, and random selfie takers who post about the brand relentlessly on social media. It is built to satisfy a very online clientele, mass-producing cheap clothes that look expensive.\u201cThey need to buy a lot of different styles and probably only wear them a couple times so their Instagram feeds can stay fresh,\u201d Richard Saghian, Fashion Nova\u2019s founder, said in an interview last year. To enable that habit, he gives them a constant stream of new options that are priced to sell.The days of $200 jeans are over, if you ask Mr. Saghian. Fashion Nova\u2019s skintight denim goes for $24.99. And, he said, the company can get its clothes made \u201cin less than two weeks,\u201d often by manufacturers in Los Angeles, a short drive from the company\u2019s headquarters. That model hints at an ugly secret behind the brand\u2019s runaway success: The federal Labor Department has found that many Fashion Nova garments are stitched together by a work force in the United States that is paid illegally low wages. ImageInfluencers and celebrities like Cardi B post about Fashion Nova on Instagram.Credit...Rich Fury/Getty Images for Fashion NovaLos Angeles is filled with factories that pay workers off the books and as little as possible, battling overseas competitors that can pay even less. Many of the people behind the sewing machines are undocumented, and unlikely to challenge their bosses.\u201cIt has all the advantages of a sweatshop system,\u201d said David Weil, who led the United States Labor Department\u2019s wage and hour division from 2014 to 2017.Every year, the department investigates allegations of wage violations at sewing contractors in Los Angeles, showing up unannounced to review payroll data, interview employees and question the owners.In investigations conducted from 2016 through this year, the department discovered Fashion Nova clothing being made in dozens of factories that owed $3.8 million in back wages to hundreds of workers, according to internal federal documents that summarized the findings and were reviewed by The New York Times.Those factories, which are hired by middlemen to produce garments for fashion brands, paid their sewers as little as $2.77 an hour, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The Labor Department declined to comment on the details of the investigations. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the department \u201ccontinues to ensure employers receive compliance assistance with the overtime and minimum wage requirements, and the Wage and Hour Division is committed to enforcing the law.\u201dAfter repeated violations were found at factories making Fashion Nova clothes, federal officials met with company representatives. \u201cWe have already had a highly productive and positive meeting with the Department of Labor in which we discussed our ongoing commitment to ensuring that all workers involved with the Fashion Nova brand are appropriately compensated for the work they do,\u201d Erica Meierhans, Fashion Nova\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement to The Times. \u201cAny suggestion that Fashion Nova is responsible for underpaying anyone working on our brand is categorically false.\u201d In 2018, Mr. Saghian said about 80 percent of the brand\u2019s clothes were made in the United States. Fashion Nova\u2019s supply chain has shifted since then, and now the brand says it makes less than half of its clothes in Los Angeles. It would not specify the overall percentage made in the United States. The company does not deal directly with factories. Instead, it places bulk orders with companies that design the clothes and then ship fabric to separately owned sewing contractors, where workers stitch the clothes together and stick Fashion Nova\u2019s label on them.The brand\u2019s clingy dresses and animal-print jumpsuits are often made by people like Mercedes Cortes, working in ramshackle buildings that smell like bathrooms.Ms. Cortes, 56, sewed Fashion Nova clothes for several months at Coco Love, a dusty factory close to Fashion Nova\u2019s offices in Vernon, Calif. \u201cThere were cockroaches. There were rats,\u201d she said. \u201cThe conditions weren\u2019t good.\u201dImageMs. Cortes would notice $12 price tags when sewing Fashion Nova clothes, which she said was \u201cvery expensive for what they pay us.\u201d\u00a0Credit...Jessica Pons for The New York TimesShe worked every day of the week, but her pay varied depending on how quickly her fingers could move. Ms. Cortes was paid for each piece of a shirt she sewed together \u2014 about 4 cents to sew on each sleeve, 5 cents for each of the side seams, 8 cents for the seam on the neckline. On average, she earned $270 in a week, the equivalent of $4.66 an hour, she said.In 2016, Ms. Cortes left Coco Love and later reached a settlement with the company for $5,000 in back wages. She continued to work in factories sewing Fashion Nova clothes, noticing the $12 price tags on the tops she had stitched together for cents. \u201cThe clothes are very expensive for what they pay us,\u201d Ms. Cortes said.\u201cConsumers can say, \u2018Well, of course that\u2019s what it\u2019s like in Bangladesh or Vietnam,\u2019 but they are developing countries,\u201d Mr. Weil said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s true in their own backyard.\u201dFor all their seediness, these factories are still producing clothes for major American retailers. Under federal law, brands cannot be penalized for wage theft in factories if they can credibly claim that they did not know their clothes were made by workers paid illegally low wages. The Labor Department has collected millions in back wages and penalties from Los Angeles garment businesses in recent years, but has not fined a retailer.This year, Fashion Nova\u2019s labels were the ones found the most frequently by federal investigators looking into garment factories that pay egregiously low wages, according to a person familiar with the investigations.In September, three officials from the department met with Fashion Nova\u2019s lawyers to tell them that, over four years, the brand\u2019s clothes had been found in 50 investigations of factories paying less than the federal minimum wage or failing to pay overtime. ImageScrap fabric from a sewing machine used by Ms. Cortes.Credit...Jessica Pons for The New York TimesThe company\u2019s lawyers told the officials that they had taken immediate action and had already updated the brand\u2019s agreement with vendors. Now, if Fashion Nova learns that a factory has been charged with violating laws \u201cgoverning the wages and hours of its employees, child labor, forced labor or unsafe working conditions,\u201d the brand will put the middleman who hired that factory on a six-month \u201cprobation,\u201d it said in a statement. The working relationship would continue, unless workers file another complaint against the same factory or another one that the contractor hired during those six months. At that point, the brand will suspend the contractor until it passes a third-party audit. While Fashion Nova has taken steps to address the Labor Department\u2019s findings, Ms. Meierhans, the brand\u2019s general counsel, noted that it works with hundreds of manufacturers and \u201cis not responsible for how these vendors handle their payrolls.\u201d\u2018Everyone wants to have more followers\u2019Mr. Saghian opened the first Fashion Nova store in 2006, in a Los Angeles mall. Seven years and four storefronts later, he realized that he was losing customers to online outlets selling the same clothes.A web developer talked him out of starting a website; it would get no traffic, because no one knew what Fashion Nova was. Mr. Saghian had a better shot on Instagram, where \u201cthere were some really basic boutiques that had 300,000 followers,\u201d he said in the interview.In 2013, Mr. Saghian opened an Instagram account and began posting photos of his clothing on mannequins and customers. He noticed that some of his stores\u2019 regular visitors were influencers he had seen on Instagram, where they had hundreds of thousands of followers.\u201cI had rappers\u2019 girlfriends, female rappers, models,\u201d he said.ImageFashion Nova makes inexpensive clothes that look expensive.Credit...Rich Fury/Getty Images for Fashion NovaImageInstagram influencers help drive sales for the company.Credit...Rich Fury/Getty Images for Fashion NovaMr. Saghian started giving them free clothing, and they posted photos of themselves draped in Fashion Nova garb. In turn, he reposted their photos and tagged their handles.\u201cEveryone wants to be famous. Everyone wants to have more followers,\u201d Mr. Saghian said. \u201cBy tagging them, the influencer would grow their following.\u201dGradually, the strategy brought Fashion Nova from the outskirts of the internet into the mainstream. The brand earned mentions on hip-hop tracks. In 2017, its sales grew by about 600 percent. Cardi B, the Grammy-winning rap star, unveiled her first collection with the brand in an Instagram video in November last year.\u201cI wanted to do something that is like, \u2018Wow, what is that? Is that Chanel? Is that YSL? Is that Gucci?\u2019 No,\u201d she said, adding an expletive, \u201cit\u2019s Fashion Nova.\u201dAll 82 styles in Cardi B\u2019s collection sold out hours after they became available. She posted another video the same night, promising a full restock \u201cin two or three weeks.\u201d (Cardi B\u2019s line is made in Los Angeles, but the government has not found any of the clothes in factories where workers have alleged they were paid less than the minimum, Fashion Nova said.)There were more searches for Fashion Nova last year than for Versace or Gucci, according to Google\u2019s year in search data. It has 17 million followers on Instagram, and at any given moment there are enough people browsing clothes on its website to fill a basketball arena, Mr. Saghian said. To keep them interested, Fashion Nova produces more than a thousand new styles every week, thanks in part to an army of local suppliers that can respond instantly to the brand\u2019s requests.\u201cIf there was a design concept that came to mind Sunday night, on a Monday afternoon I would have a sample,\u201d he said.ImageA Los Angeles factory where a supplier of clothing to Fashion Nova outsources manufacturing.\u00a0\u00a0Credit...Jessica Pons for The New York Times\u2018The best possible price\u2019Many of the people vying for Mr. Saghian\u2019s business occupy glass-walled storefronts jammed into the six frenetic blocks of the garment district in downtown Los Angeles.These are the companies that design clothing samples and sell them in bulk to Fashion Nova and other retailers. Those businesses outsource the job of making clothes to nearby factories that work as subcontractors.In November, The Times visited seven companies that got Fashion Nova clothes made in factories that underpaid workers, according to the Labor Department investigations. Some spoke freely about their work with the brand. Others refused to comment or talked on the condition of anonymity, fearing that they might lose the company as a client if they went on the record.The five owners and employees who agreed to be interviewed said Fashion Nova would always push to pay the lowest price possible for each garment, and would demand a quick turnaround. \u201cThey give me the best possible price they can give it to me, for that will allow them to still break a profit,\u201d Mr. Saghian said.The companies can negotiate with Fashion Nova, but their power is limited. A dwindling number of retailers are still doing business in Los Angeles, and a couple of big orders from Fashion Nova can keep a small garment shop afloat for another year. So they look for subcontractors who can sew clothes as quickly and cheaply as possible.ImageA garment worker recalled her factory\u2019s receiving orders from Fashion Nova for up to 5,000 pieces of clothing at a time.Credit...Jessica Pons for The New York TimesAmante Clothing, which occupies a stuffy storefront filled with racks of colorful samples, regularly works with Fashion Nova. The brand paid Amante $7.15 per top for a bulk order last year, according to a Labor Department investigation conducted last December. Amante then went to a sewing contractor called Karis Apparel, which made the tops.Amante paid Karis $2.20 to sew each garment, the Labor Department found. Fashion Nova sold the top for $17.99.\u201cWe don\u2019t own the sewing contractor, so whatever the sewing contractor does, that\u2019s his problem,\u201d said a designer at Amante, who declined to be named for fear of losing her job. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they do to give us the lowest price. We assume they\u2019re paying their employees the minimum.\u201d Karis, the factory that worked with Amante, went out of business in April. Another manufacturer ensnared in the investigations moved production to Mexico this year.But many more factories have evaded punishment.Same owners, different namesWhen Teresa Garcia started working at Sugar Sky, it was called Xela Fashion. It was 2014, and Xela Fashion, state records show, was owned by Demetria Sajche, a woman whom Ms. Garcia was told to call Angelina.Several months later \u2014 Ms. Garcia does not remember how many \u2014 the name on her checks had changed, though she worked in the same grungy factory in the heart of downtown, a few blocks from a SoulCycle.ImageTeresa Garcia next to her sewing machine at home. She sewed at a factory that specialized in Fashion Nova clothes.Credit...Jessica Pons for The New York TimesNow her employer was called Nena Fashion, a company that was founded by Leslie Sajche, a relative of Ms. Garcia\u2019s boss, according to business records filed with California\u2019s secretary of state. About a year after that, the name changed again, to GYA Fashion. In 2017, the factory moved to an industrial stretch of Olympic Boulevard in East Los Angeles and began using a new new name: Sugar Sky. About a year later, Ms. Sajche stopped running the day-to-day operations and handed the job over to Eric Alfredo Ajitaz Puac, whom workers knew as her boyfriend.Ms. Garcia said that she believed the point of all the name changes was to avoid being shut down by federal or state officials. Several workers, including Ms. Garcia, have filed claims against Xela, Nena, Gya and Sugar Sky for back wages with California\u2019s labor commissioner, the state agency that handles such disputes. In her claim, which is active, Ms. Garcia included checks showing she earned as little as $225 for 65 hours of work in a week, the equivalent of $3.46 an hour. She remembers the factory\u2019s receiving orders from Fashion Nova for up to 5,000 pieces of clothing at a time. \u201cThey needed it so fast, they couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Ms. Garcia said of the brand. \u201cWe would need to turn it around within a week.\u201d Weeks of trying to reach Mr. Puac and Ms. Sajche were unsuccessful. A trip to Sugar Sky\u2019s last known location just before Thanksgiving found a furniture store. Neighbors said the garment factory had packed up and moved out two months earlier.Fernando Axjup, who was listed as an owner of one iteration of the factory, agreed to an interview. He was recently fired from the company and had filed his own claim for back wages.Image\u201cThere was a lot of exploitation,\u201d Fernando Axjup said of a factory where he worked.Credit...Jessica Pons for The New York Times\u201cThey keep changing their names so they don\u2019t have to pay people,\u201d Mr. Axjup said. \u201cThere was a lot of exploitation.\u201d As a manager, he had access to payroll data and said Ms. Garcia rarely earned the minimum wage.Mr. Axjup suggested that perhaps he had been fired for standing up for workers like Ms. Garcia. Ms. Garcia said she doubted that, given that Mr. Axjup was the one ordering her to hurry up.He said he could never figure out why Fashion Nova did not visit the factory floor to check on how its clothes were being made for such low prices.\u201cSupposedly, the brand should supervise the people who give them work, to find out whether they are being paid well,\u201d Mr. Axjup said. \u201cBut they never do. They never came to see.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/style/garment-workers-around-the-world.html", "title": "Who Made Your Clothes?", "summary": "", "authors": "By Sanam Yar", "text": "\u2018It\u2019s a good factory, so no one really quits.\u2019Rumsinah, 44 Role: Zipper operator at PT.

My brother tried calling me, but management didn\u2019t tell me about it until my family had already held his funeral. I was so upset, I quit my job.Now that I\u2019m in security, I know when someone comes to the mill and tries to contact a worker. But I\u2019m still not allowed to tell the worker their relative has been trying to reach them.It\u2019s not just difficult, it\u2019s impossible to survive on the salary the textile mills pay.

Their clothes were torn, and many of their valuables, including phones and jewelry, were taken.The employees took their complaint to the labor department. The issues were resolved three months after the incident, after the factory faced public pressure from a report by an American watchdog group, social media and brands that worked with the factory.Some conditions have improved: Employees get mineral water now.

Under the pattern-cutting table there are bins of scraps of scraps, sorted by color (red and yellow and blue and black), and on one wall are shelves of Mason jars containing gumball-size scraps of scraps of scraps; up front are clothing rails, and a dressing room canopied by a lavish waterfall of castoff cuttings that flows down onto the floor like a Gaud\u00ed sand castle.The ragpicker of Brooklyn, whose name is Daniel Silverstein and whose nom de style is Zero Waste Daniel, looks like a fashion kid, which he is (or was). He is 30 and tends to dress all in black, with a black knit cap on his head, and went to the Fashion Institute of Technology and interned at Carolina Herrera and even was on a fashion reality TV show.And the ragpicker of Brooklyn would rather not be called that at all.\u201cI prefer to think of it as Rumpelstiltskin, spinning straw into gold,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said one day in early November. He was on West 35th Street, in the garment district, with his partner and husband, Mario DeMarco (also all in black). They were hauling home sacks of cuttings from their own production run at HD Fashion, which also makes clothes for Rag & Bone and Donna Karan\u2019s Urban Zen line.Mr. Silverstein\u2019s straw is more formally known as preconsumer, postproduction waste, which is a fancy way of saying he works with the fabrics that other designers and costume departments and factories would normally throw out. ImageDaniel Silverstein\u2019s fashion line, Zero Waste Daniel, uses garment scraps to produce streetwear.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesHis gold is street wear: sweatshirts and pants and T-shirts, the occasional anorak, collaged together from rolls of old fabric, mostly black and gray, often containing brightly colored geometric patchwork inserts of smaller, brighter bits, like an exclamation point, or an Easter egg. Those patchwork inserts have been put together from the castoffs of the bigger pieces, and then the castoffs from the inserts are saved and pieced together into mosaic appliqu\u00e9s (the hands from the Sistine Chapel and Earth as seen from above, for example). The appliqu\u00e9s can be custom-made and attached to any piece. Leftovers, all the way.As fashion comes to grips with its own culpability in the climate crisis, the concept of upcycling, whether remaking old clothes or re-engineering used fabric or simply using what would otherwise be tossed into landfill, has begun to trickle out to many layers of the fashion world. That includes the high end, via the work of designers like Marine Serre, Emily Bode and Gabriela Hearst, and brands like Herm\u00e8s, as well as the outdoor space, with the Patagonia WornWear and Recrafted programs (to name a few).And yet, because there are few economies of scale and even fewer production systems, such clothing remains for many designers an experiment rather than a strategy, and for many consumers, a luxury rather than a choice.Mr. Silverstein, whose clothes range from $25 for a patch to $595 for an anorak made from what was a New York City Sanitation Department tent, and who works only with fabric that would otherwise be thrown away, is one of several new designers trying to change that.How he got there, with lots of false starts and belly flops, is perhaps as representative as anything of the way fashion may be stumbling toward its future. We make too much, and we buy too much, but that doesn\u2019t have to mean we waste too much. Welcome to the growing world of trashion.ImageJars of tiny clothing scraps organized by color on a shelf in the back of the Zero Waste Daniel store.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesSaved By the Dumpster\u201cI came to New York for that fashion dream \u2014 what I\u2019d been watching on TV,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said a few weeks before his garment district scrap-saving trip. \u201cI wanted that life so badly.\u201dHe was sitting in the back of what he calls his \u201cmake/shop,\u201d which he and Mr. DeMarco renovated in 2017 using materials from Big Reuse, a Brooklyn nonprofit. The make/shop has three sewing machines but no garbage can.Mr. Silverstein was born in Pennsylvania, and when he was 10, his parents moved to New Jersey so their fashion-aware son could be closer to New York. Mr. Silverstein\u2019s father owned a swimming pool and hot tub supply company, and his mother worked part-time in the business. (She is also a therapist.) As a family, they did some recycling but were not particularly attuned to the environment. Mr. Silverstein always knew he wanted to be a designer. When he was 4, he started making clothes for his sister\u2019s Barbies out of tissue paper and tinfoil. By the time he was 14, he was taking weekend classes at F.I.T. and making his friends\u2019 prom dresses.His Damascene moment was more like a series of cold-water splashes. For a senior-year competition for the Clinton Global Initiative, he designed a pair of sustainable jeans, which became his first zero-waste pattern. He didn\u2019t win, but his teacher told him to hold on to the idea. \u201c\u2018You have something there,\u2019\u201d he recalled the teacher saying.After graduating, he found himself working as a temp at Victoria\u2019s Secret, making knitwear. He would scroll through style.com looking at recent runway shows, find a sweater he liked, then create a technical design packet for a similar style for VS. One of the patterns involved an asymmetric cut with a long triangular piece in front. Because of the irregular shape, the fabric \u201chad an insanely poor yield,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said, meaning that only a portion of every yard was used for the garment; almost half was waste. He did the math and realized, he said, \u201cthat if this is yielding only 47 percent per each sweater, and we are cutting 10,000 sweaters, then we are knitting, milling, dying and finishing 5,000 yards of fabric just to throw out.\u201dThe next day, he said, he left VS to focus on a business he and a friend had started based on his zero-waste patterns. They were making classic ready-to-wear \u2014 cocktail dresses and suits and such \u2014 but with no waste left on the cutting-room floor. One of their first customers was Jennifer Hudson, who wore a turquoise dress that ended up in the pages of Us Weekly. Stores like Fred Segal in Los Angeles and e-tail sites like Master & Muse picked up the line, which was called 100% (for the amount of fabric used), and Mr. Silverstein spent a season on the \u201cFashion Star,\u201d ending his tenure as second runner-up. ImageA coat made out of a former DSNY promotional tent hanging in the Zero Waster Daniel Brooklyn store.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesStill, the economics of fashion, in which stores pay after delivery, were working against him. In 2015, after American Apparel, which had bought Oak NYC, a store known for its edgy choices and one of his wholesale accounts, declared bankruptcy, he was left with $30,000 worth of unpaid orders. He decided to quit.Mr. Silverstein got a part-time job helping students get their art portfolios together and, he said, \u201clay on the couch for a while.\u201d Finally he boxed up his studio and threw all of his leftover fabric in a garbage bag. He was set to haul it to a dumpster, only to have the bag break, spilling its contents onto the floor. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can\u2019t throw this out \u2014 it\u2019s the antithesis of my mission,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo I took the afternoon and made myself a shirt and put it on my Instagram. I had maybe 2,000 followers, and probably the most likes I had ever gotten was 95. I posted this dumb selfie of a shirt I\u2019d made out of my own trash because I was too poor to go shopping, and it instantly got 200 likes. It was the most popular thing I\u2019d ever done.\u201dIt occurred to him this may be a better way to go. He made \u201ca bunch of scrappy shirts\u201d and became Zero Waste Daniel, his Instagram name (which he had chosen because Daniel Silverstein was already taken). He rented a booth at a flea market and sold them all. Johnny Wujek, Katy Perry\u2019s stylist, bought one. Chris Anderson, a mentor who ran Dress for Success in Morris County, N.J., where Mr. Silverstein had interned during high school, said she would back him. His father put in some money, too, as did Tuomo Tiisala, a professor at New York University who saw his work at a market. Mr. Silverstein got a small space at Manufacture New York, a group incubator in Sunset Park (it disbanded after a year), and made a deal with a factory that supplied the Marshalls chain to pick up its scraps.Fabric dumping, though less discussed than the clothes consumers throw out, is just as much a byproduct of fashion production, and just as culpable in the landfill crisis. Reverse Resources, a group that has created an online marketplace to connect factories and designers who want to reuse their scraps, released a study in 2016 that estimated that the garment industry creates almost enough leftover textile per year to cover the entire republic of Estonia with waste. That was a best-case scenario. Worst case would be enough to cover North Korea.At that stage, Mr. Silverstein was mostly making sweatshirts, piecing them together by hand, but, he said, \u201cpeople started making little videos about my work and putting up posts, and I started getting more orders than I could keep up with.\u201d In 2017, he met Mr. DeMarco, who worked in hospitality. This year he joined the business full-time.In many ways, social media has also been their door to a customer base. Just as it creates pressure to buy new stuff, it can create pressure to buy new old stuff.ImageMr. Silverstein sewing one of the DSNY shirts in his make/shop. The front is the retail space; the back is his atelier.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesMessage vs. Money\u201cMy freshman year at F.I.T., one of my teachers said there are good designers and there are great designers,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said. \u201cGood designers have careers and see their stuff in stores, and great designers change the way people dress.\u201d And, perhaps, think about dress.\u201dHe was driving a small U-Haul truck. He had spent the morning with Mr. DeMarco in FabScrap, a concrete loft in the erstwhile Army Terminal complex in Sunset Park filled with trash bags and storage boxes bulging at the seams with fabric waste. They were on the hunt for 400 or so yards of random black remnants with some stretch. Mr. Silverstein doesn\u2019t ragpick in the 19th-century way (the way that gave birth to the term), sifting through garbage on the streets. He picks through giant boxes and metal shelves of castoff fabric rolls and then sews his finds together to make new rolls.He doesn\u2019t really have seasons or shows by a traditional definition, though he flirts with the idea. In 2018, the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge invited him to do a show for New York Fashion Week, and instead of a runway, he decided to do a one-man stand-up routine called \u201cSustainable Fashion Is Hilarious,\u201d which was more about concept than clothes. The hotel sold tickets online, and all of the proceeds went to Fashion Revolution, a nonprofit that advocates industry reform. In September, he did the same at the Ace hotel in Manhattan. Mr. Silverstein is planning a performance for February at Arcadia Earth, the climate installation museum in downtown New York, which also sells some of his work.Last year the Sanitation Department came calling. It had done a collaboration with the designer Heron Preston and was looking for another partner. While Mr. Preston saw the opportunity as a way to elevate the role of the sanitation worker in a one-off show, Mr. Silverstein saw it as a great partnership for raw material. The department\u2019s dead-stock T-shirts, tents and tablecloths have proven something of a treasure trove for him. Over Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Silverstein was one of the star companies in an American Express showcase on Small Business Saturday. He is also teaming up with a former mentor at Swimwear Anywhere for a line of bathing suits made in Taiwan, which will be his first foray into offshore production. (The scraps will be sent back along with the trunks and one-pieces, which are made from recycled ocean fishing nets.)Recently Lin-Manuel Miranda wore a Zero Waste Daniel sweatshirt at an Amex event. The drag queen Pattie Gonia wore a long mosaic gown based on Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d at the Tony Awards in June and made Vogue\u2019s best-dressed slide show, albeit without identification. The company has been profitable for a year, Mr. Silverstein said, and ships across the United States as well as to Canada, Britain, Brazil and Germany. Now Mr. Silverstein is at another turning point. Does he get bigger? Does he train other ragpickers to do what he does? Does he open another outlet?

But it depends on the kind of coffee and the quantity.", "authors": "By Dawn MacKeen", "text": "We\u2019ve come a long way from the cans of Folgers that filled our grandparents\u2019 cupboards, with our oat milk lattes, cold brews and Frappuccinos. Some of us are still very utilitarian about the drink while others perform elaborate rituals. The fourth most popular beverage in the country, coffee is steeped into our culture. Just the right amount can improve our mood; too much may make us feel anxious and jittery.Is coffee good for me?Yes.In moderation, coffee seems to be good for most people \u2014 that\u2019s 3 to 5 cups daily, or up to 400 milligrams of caffeine.\u201cThe evidence is pretty consistent that coffee is associated with a lower risk of mortality,\u201d said Erikka Loftfield, a research fellow at the National Cancer Institute who has studied the beverage.For years, coffee was believed to be a possible carcinogen, but the 2015 Dietary Guidelines helped to change perception. For the first time, moderate coffee drinking was included as part of a healthy diet. When researchers controlled for lifestyle factors, like how many heavy coffee drinkers also smoked, the data tipped in coffee\u2019s favor.A large 2017 review on coffee consumption and human health in the British Medical Journal also found that most of the time, coffee was associated with a benefit, rather than a harm. In examining more than 200 reviews of previous studies, the authors observed that moderate coffee drinkers had less cardiovascular disease, and premature death from all causes, including heart attacks and stroke, than those skipping the beverage.In addition, experts say some of the strongest protective effects may be with Type 2 diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and liver conditions such as cirrhosis, liver cancer and chronic liver disease. For example, having about five cups of coffee a day, instead of none, is correlated with a 30 percent decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes, according to a meta-analysis of 30 studies.The potential benefit from coffee might be from the polyphenols, which are plant compounds that have antioxidant properties, according to Dr. Giuseppe Grosso, an assistant professor in human nutrition at University of Catania in Italy and the lead author of an umbrella review in the Annual Review of Nutrition.However, coffee isn\u2019t for everyone. There are concerns about overconsumption. This is especially true for expecting mothers because the safety of caffeine during pregnancy is unclear. While the research into coffee\u2019s impact on health is ongoing, most of the work in this field is observational.\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure if coffee is the cause of the health benefits,\u201d said Jonathan Fallowfield, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, and co-author of the British Medical Journal review. \u201cThese findings could be due to other factors or behaviors present in coffee drinkers.\u201dDoes the way coffee is prepared matter?Yes. Do you prefer a dark or light roast? Coarse grinding or fine? Arabica or robusta?\u201cAll of these different aspects affect the taste, but also affect the compounds within the coffees,\u201d said Neal Freedman, a senior investigator with the National Cancer Institute. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear at all how these different levels of compounds may be related to health.\u201dRoasting, for example, reduces the amount of chlorogenic acids, but other antioxidant compounds are formed. Espresso has the highest concentration of many compounds because it has less water than drip coffee.A study in JAMA Internal Medicine examined the coffee habits of nearly 500,000 people in the U.K. and found that it didn\u2019t matter if they drank one cup or chain-drank eight \u2014 regular or decaf \u2014 or whether they were fast metabolizers of coffee or slow. They were linked to a lower risk of death from all causes, except with instant coffee, the evidence was weaker.The way you prepare your cup of joe may influence your cholesterol levels, too. \u201cThe one coffee we know not suitable to be drinking is the boiled coffee,\u201d said Marilyn C. Cornelis, an assistant professor in preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and co-author of the JAMA Internal Medicine study.Examples of this include the plunge-happy French press, Scandinavian coffee, or Greek and Turkish coffee \u2014 the kind commonly consumed in the Middle East. (When poured, the unfiltered grounds settle on the tiny cup\u2019s bottom like sludge. To peek into the future, elders in the region have a tradition of reading the sediment of an overturned cup, like a crystal ball.)However, the oil in boiled coffee has cafestol and kahweol, compounds called diterpenes. They are shown to raise LDL, the bad cholesterol, and slightly lower HDL, what\u2019s known as the good kind.\u201cIf you filter the coffee, then it\u2019s no issue at all,\u201d said Rob van Dam, a professor at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National University of Singapore. \u201cFor people with cholesterol issues, it\u2019s better to switch to other types of coffee.\u201d He\u2019s been studying coffee for two decades. (And, yes, he\u2019s had a lot of coffee in that time.)However, other researchers say not to throw out the boiled coffee just yet. The clinical significance of such small increases in cholesterol may be questionable, given that it\u2019s not associated with an increase in cardiovascular deaths.Many consumers have also swapped loose grounds for coffee pods. While there are environmental concerns with single use pods, researchers believe them to hold the same benefits as, say, drip coffee. The latter applies to cold brew, too, but more research is needed.Is This A Scam?"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html", "title": "What Is the Keto Diet and Does It Work?", "summary": "Yes. But we don\u2019t know how effective, or for how long. ", "authors": "By Dawn MacKeen", "text": "A recent survey of registered dietitians named the low-carbohydrate keto diet yet again as the most popular diet in the United States. Powering this diet is fat, and loads of it \u2014 all the way up to a hefty 90 percent of one\u2019s daily calories.Its fans (and marketers) feed social media with before and after photos, crediting the diet for life-altering weight loss or other effects. They swirl butter into their coffee, load up on cheese and eat lonely burgers without their bestie: the bun. Staples like whole grains, legumes, fruit and starchy vegetables are being largely pushed off the plate as devotees strive for ketosis \u2014 when the body begins to burn fat instead of glucose as its primary energy source.\u201cAmerica is in a state of carbophobia,\u201d said Whitney Linsenmeyer, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.The diet is hailed for dropping pounds, burning more calories, reducing hunger, managing diabetes, treating drug resistant epilepsy, improving blood pressure and lowering cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, the major storage form of fat in the body. People have reported improved concentration, too. \u201cWe see pretty dramatic benefits,\u201d said Dr. William Yancy, director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center.First, a word: Choosing an eating plan or an approach to eating is very personal. Everyone\u2019s body, tastes and background are unique. The best approach to food intake is one in which you are healthy and nurtured and which matches your social and cultural preference. If you want guidance, it\u2019s recommended you consult with a registered dietitian.What is the ketogenic diet?A \u201ctypical\u201d ketogenic diet consists of at least 70 percent of calories derived from fat, less than 10 percent from carbs and less than 20 percent from protein. The ketogenic diet, long used to treat epilepsy in children, calls for 90 percent of daily calories to come from fat, with the amount of protein or carbs varying as long as it\u2019s 4 grams of fat for every combined 1 gram of carb and protein, according to the American Epilepsy Society. That can mean chowing down on a lot of cheese, butter, eggs, nuts, salmon, bacon, olive oil and non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, greens and spinach. For the arithmetic-challenged, apps and online programs can do the math for you. (No matter what, the keto diet is vastly different than the USDA dietary recommendations of 45 to 65 percent of one\u2019s total calories to be carbohydrates, 20 to 35 percent from fat and 10 to 35 percent from protein.)The goal of the ketogenic diet is to enter a state of ketosis through fat metabolism. In a ketogenic state, the body uses primarily fat for energy instead of carbohydrates; with low levels of carbohydrate, fats can be converted into ketones to fuel the body.For ketosis, a typical adult must stay below 20 to 50 grams of net carbohydrates \u2014 measured as total carbs minus fiber \u2014 each day. Crossing that threshold is easy: a thick slice of bread adds 21 carbohydrates, a medium apple 25 and a cup of milk 12. \u201cIt\u2019s very restrictive,\u201d said Carla Prado, an associate professor and director of the University of Alberta\u2019s Human Nutrition Research Unit. It\u2019s not just bread and soda that are on the outs but high-sugar fruit and starchy veggies like potatoes, as well as too much protein. Also, dieters have to be on high alert for hidden carbs, often invisible to the eye, yet coating that seemingly keto-friendly fried cheese.Can I lose weight on the keto diet?Yes. Certainly in the short-term, it appears that way. For the first two to six months, there\u2019s evidence that a very low-carbohydrate diet can help you lose more weight than the standard high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, according to a new literature review of low-carb diets by the National Lipid Association.\u201cBy 12 months, that advantage is essentially gone,\u201d said Carol F. Kirkpatrick, director of Idaho State University\u2019s Wellness Center, and lead author of the new literature review. After that, weight loss seems to equalize between those two popular diet regimens. She said keto was best used to kick-start a diet, before transitioning to a carb intake that you can adhere to for the longer term.How long does it take to see results on the keto diet?For some, it\u2019s the promised land of diets. Instead of cringing through carrot sticks, they can fill up guilt-free on chorizo with scrambled eggs. Indeed, some evidence suggests that people feel less hungry while in ketosis, and have fewer cravings. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s become so popular for the general population,\u201d said Dr. Mackenzie C. Cervenka, medical director of Johns Hopkins Hospital\u2019s Adult Epilepsy Diet Center. \u201cBecause once you are in ketosis, it\u2019s easy to follow.\u201d Usually, it takes between one to four days to enter the state, doctors say, but it depends on many factors like activity level: a runner, for example, may sprint there faster than a couch potato. The keto diet appears to deliver fast results: The first pounds may seem to slip off. That can be seductive but it\u2019s likely water weight. Then, dietitians say, it\u2019s back to energy in minus energy out. You can absolutely gain weight on any diet if you\u2019re consuming 5,000 calories a day, according to Dr. Linsenmeyer, who is also director of Saint Louis University\u2019s Didactic Program in Dietetics. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it is going to magically alter your metabolism to where calories don\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d she said. And when resuming the carbs, that water weight returns.Is This A Scam?"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/style/self-care/probiotics-benefits.html", "title": "What Are the Benefits of Probiotics?", "summary": "Studies suggest that certain probiotics can help in certain contexts.

Probiotics are live micro-organisms, usually bacteria, that provide health benefits when consumed at appropriate doses. According to some surveys, approximately four million Americans take probiotics, which are available as pills, powders, foods and drinks. Probiotics are a huge industry \u2014 at least a $40 billion dollar one, according to Zion Market Research \u2014 and popular brands sell for 35 cents to $1 a dose, with a shelf life of several months. Proponents argue that they improve the composition of the gut microbiome, which is involved in many aspects of health including immunity, metabolism and mood.Framed this way, probiotics may seem like a no-brainer. But before you reach for your wallet, keep in mind that while many scientists and doctors believe that probiotics have promise, they also say that a lot of products on the market don\u2019t live up to the hype. \u201cThe current evidence does not convince me to recommend probiotics for any of my healthy patients,\u201d said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance. In a review of the scientific literature on probiotics published in January 2019, researchers concluded that \u201cthe benefits and feasibility of probiotic consumption in healthy adults remain uncertain.\u201d Recent research has raised questions about how well probiotics are tested for safety, too.Are there benefits to probiotics?Some clinical studies suggest that certain probiotics can help in certain contexts. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can help treat irritable bowel syndrome (I.B.S.), while Saccharomyces boulardii, a yeast, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG can each reduce the risk of diarrhea in adults taking antibiotics. Specific probiotics have also been shown to help treat pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, colic and infectious diarrhea, and to reduce the risk of developing Clostridium difficile infections after taking antibiotics.To understand the various contexts in which probiotics could be useful, check out this guide recommended by Gregor Reid, a microbiologist and immunologist at Western University in Ontario, Canada, and the former president of the industry-funded International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), although some products on the list are backed by more research than others. And no matter what the science says, probiotics sold as dietary supplements are not disease-treating drugs. If companies want to market their probiotics as medical treatments, they have to pursue a form of Food and Drug Administration approval to market them as live biotherapeutic products. Thus far, no probiotics have been given this designation.Are probiotics a scam?With probiotics, details matter. It\u2019s silly to walk into a drugstore, grab a probiotic off the shelf and think it\u2019s going to do you any good. Be wary, too, of recommendations made by people who haven\u2019t consulted the scientific literature. \u201cDon\u2019t blindly trust a pharmacist, doctor, health-food shop attendant or dietary book, as sadly, most are ill informed,\u201d Dr. Reid said. But if a doctor you trust recommends a particular strain that has been shown in clinical studies to help your condition, or if you have identified a strain that is backed up by solid clinical research and really want to give it a try, then sure, go ahead \u2014 after double-checking with your doctor first. Don\u2019t expect miracles, however.So what are the issues with probiotics?There is still the question of whether some probiotics stick around long enough in the body to do anything. In a 2018 study published in Cell, a team of scientists gave Supherb\u2019s Bio-25, a mixture of 11 bacterial strains commercially available in Israel, to 10 healthy people for four weeks and found that the probiotics passed right through four of them.

Are these people just annoying or are they onto something?Generally, intermittent fasting is a diet strategy that involves alternating periods of eating and extended fasting (meaning no food at all or very low calorie consumption). \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of debate in our research community: How much of the benefits of intermittent fasting are just due to the fact that it helps people eat less? Could you get the same benefits by just cutting your calories by the same amount?\u201d said Courtney M.

We asked Dr. Peterson and a few other experts to help us sort out the real from the scam on intermittent fasting.How do I try intermittent fasting?There are four popular fasting approaches: periodic fasting, time-restricted feeding, alternate-day fasting and the 5:2 diet. Time-restricted feeding, sometimes called daily intermittent fasting, is perhaps the easiest and most popular fasting method. Daily intermittent fasters restrict eating to certain time periods each day, say 11 in the morning to 7 at night. The fasting period is usually around 12 or more hours that, helpfully, includes time spent sleeping overnight. Periodic fasting will feel most familiar: no food or drinks with calories for 24-hour periods. Another type of fast, alternate-day fasting requires severe calorie reduction every other day. Lastly, the 5:2 method was popularized by author Kate Harrison\u2019s book \u201cThe 5:2 Diet\" and requires fasting on two nonconsecutive days a week.Is This A Scam?"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/style/self-care/collagen-benefits.html", "title": "Are There Benefits to Collagen Supplements? ", "summary": "Maybe! But get ready for a long-term relationship. ", "authors": "By Gabriela Ulloa", "text": "It will make your skin look dewy and fresh, your bones and nails strong, and your joints pain-free. These are the claims made by the countless manufacturers of collagen supplements that come in the form of powders, pills and creams. For that reason, it\u2019s no surprise that collagen has become a widely sought-after ingredient in the wellness and beauty communities. But collagen\u2019s efficacy is still pretty up in the air. Frustrated? Here\u2019s what we know. What is collagen?Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the body. In fact, collagen is \u201cthe main structural protein that forms the connective tissue throughout our body, from skin to bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments,\u201d said Dr. Shari Marchbein, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York. It\u2019s no wonder that the bottled up version of this protein (usually made of animal collagen) is in high demand.Collagen makes up a whopping 80 percent of our skin, and works with another protein called elastin that \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 keeps our skin elastic. But as we age, our bodies naturally start reducing collagen production. The board-certified dermatologist Dr. Whitney Bowe described our body\u2019s collagen as \u201cropes of protein in the skin.\u201d When we\u2019re young, the rope remains tight, but as we age, the ends begin to fray. Essentially, our bodies are not able to replace the collagen we are losing as quickly as it is breaking down. Starting in our 20s, we begin losing about 1 percent of our collagen each year, said Dr. Bowe. This, unfortunately, means drier skin. Sun exposure, cigarette smoke and pollution can also accelerate collagen breakdown. \u201cThe concept of supplementing our collagen, especially as we age and as our body\u2019s natural collagen production declines, is incredibly appealing from a dermatologic standpoint,\u201d she said. Collagen peptides (also referred to as hydrolyzed collagen) which are in supplements, are different. They\u2019re made of the same amino acids as collagen but are more easily absorbed by our bodies. That\u2019s because they are much shorter chains of amino acids than collagen, making them more easily absorbed into our bloodstream (i.e. more digestible). That said, Dr. Marchbein reminds us that, \u201chow much of the supplement is absorbed and whether those amino acids make it to their target organs to act as the building blocks to make more collagen is still up for debate.\u201d Be sure to look at the label as companies often, or at least should, disclose what their product contains. Does collagen work?Some studies show that taking collagen supplements for several months can improve skin elasticity, (i.e., wrinkles and roughness) as well as signs of aging. Others have shown that consuming collagen can increase density in bones weakened with age and can improve joint, back and knee pain."}, null, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/generation-z-millennials-work-life-balance.html", "title": "Young People Are Going to Save Us All From Office Life ", "summary": "", "authors": "By Claire Cain Miller and Sanam Yar", "text": "When Ariel Coleman, 28, quit her last job, as a project manager in the corporate office of a bank, it wasn\u2019t because her new employer offered her a raise, a different role or more seniority. \u201cThe work-life balance is just much better,\u201d she said.At her new company, Omfgco, a branding and design firm in Portland, Ore., everyone works from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays at whichever hours they choose.

It has caused burnout, unhappiness and gender inequity, as people struggle to find time for children or passions or pets or any sort of life besides what they do for a paycheck. But increasingly, younger workers are pushing back. More of them expect and demand flexibility \u2014 paid leave for a new baby, say, and generous vacation time, along with daily things, like the ability to work remotely, come in late or leave early, or make time for exercise or meditation. The rest of their lives happens on their phones, not tied to a certain place or time \u2014 why should work be any different?Today\u2019s young workers have been called lazy and entitled. Could they, instead, be among the first to understand the proper role of work in life \u2014 and end up remaking work for everyone else? It\u2019s still rare for companies to operate this way, and the obstacles are bigger than any one company\u2019s H.R. policies. Some older employees may think new hires should suffer the way they did, and employers benefit from having always-on workers. Even those that are offering more flexibility might be doing it because unemployment is so low and they\u2019re competing for workers, which could change if there is an economic downturn. Also, it\u2019s a luxury to be able to demand flexibility in the first place. Those who can tend to have college degrees and white-collar careers, and can afford to take a pay cut in exchange, or be highly selective about their jobs. That\u2019s a kind of freedom that people in vast sectors of the economy don\u2019t have \u2014 and often, it\u2019s given to highly regarded employees on a one-off basis, but not to everyone at a firm. Still, there are signs that things could change for more workers. Some large and influential companies, including Walmart and Apple, have recently begun talking about the need to shift from prioritizing shareholders above all else to taking care of their employees too. And as more millennials become bosses and more job seekers demand a saner way to work, companies will have no choice. \u201cThey have proven the model that you don\u2019t need to be in the office 9 to 5 to be effective,\u201d said Ana Recio, the executive vice president of global recruiting at Salesforce, the tech company. \u201cThis generation is single-handedly paving the way for the entire work force to do their jobs remotely and flexibly.\u201d When Your Office Is on a Mountain TrailA survey by PwC, an accounting and consulting firm, found that for millennials, work is a thing, not a place. Flexibility no longer means what it did to older generations \u2014 the ability to work from home when a plumber is coming or a child is sick. But it\u2019s also not about 21st-century perks like free meals, on-site dry cleaning and Wi-Fi-equipped shuttles that help keep people at work longer. Instead, it\u2019s about employees shaping their jobs in ways that fit with their daily lives. That could mean working remotely or shifting hours when needed. More companies are offering sabbaticals; free plane tickets for vacations; meditation rooms; exercise or therapy breaks; paid time off to volunteer; and extended paid family leave. One firm has an employee who works mostly from places like Hawaii and Costa Rica. At another, someone worked remotely while living out of a van for three months, skiing in the mornings and working in the afternoons. One person goes to the office at midnight so he can surf in the morning, and another takes Fridays off to backpack.\u201cThey\u2019re maybe not on the partner track, but they\u2019re not being penalized,\u201d said Abby Engers, a strategist at Boly:Welch, an employment search firm in Portland, Ore. \u201cPeople are burnt out. They\u2019re making a commitment to themselves to take time off. If they see you\u2019re doing the work and doing it well, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re doing it at 10 p.m. or 10 a.m.\u201d And it\u2019s no longer just mothers of young children who are using flexible schedules. Women get penalized when that happens \u2014 social scientists call it the flexibility stigma \u2014 and their careers often never recover in terms of pay or promotions. But if more fathers and people who aren\u2019t parents ask for flexibility, the stigma could lessen. Jonathan Wong, 36, worked 80-hour weeks in management consulting when he became a father. His son would cry every time he saw his roller bag packed for another work trip, he said, and it was hard to take a break even to FaceTime his son before bedtime. So he moved to a job at RAND Corporation, the nonprofit policy research group \u2014 and took a 30 percent pay cut. \u201cI can bring my kid to preschool every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the overwork problem will ever be solved, guys need to be part of the solution.\u201d Some employers aren\u2019t comfortable giving people autonomy over where and when they work. \u201cWhen younger workers talk about balance, what they are saying is, \u2018I will work hard for you, but I also need a life,\u2019\u201d said Cali Williams Yost, the chief executive and founder of Flex Strategy Group, which helps organizations build flexible work cultures. \u201cUnfortunately, what leaders hear is, \u2018I want to work less.\u2019\u201d But employees say that when they\u2019re not forced to cleave life from work, they work more, and more efficiently. Melanie Neiman, 28, is a project manager at Breather, a work space rental company. Unlike at her former, more traditional job, she comes in later in the morning because she is more productive that way, and visits her family more often because she can work from where they live. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on vacation, if my Slack pings on my phone, I\u2019ll probably answer it, so maybe I work more,\u201d she said. Yet she is happy to answer messages when traveling, she said, because it\u2019s on her terms. \u201cI would never answer emails at my old job on vacation.\u201d Taking Care of Employees, TooSocial scientists have found that not all young people are asking for these benefits, even if they want them, because they fear they will be perceived as lazy or disloyal. Even when they aspire to more balanced lives, they often find that traditional workplaces won\u2019t enable it. But dozens of consulting and research firms that have surveyed young people have found that for them, flexibility is a job requirement. When Pew Research Center asked which work arrangement would be most helpful to people, young people were more likely than older people to say the flexibility to choose when they worked. Of people 18 to 29, men were more likely than women to say it, and people without children at home were as likely as parents to say it. In a survey of 11,000 workers and 6,500 business leaders by Harvard Business School and Boston Consulting Group, the vast majority said that among the new developments most urgently affecting their businesses were employees\u2019 expectations for flexible, autonomous work; better work-life balance; and remote working. (Just 30 percent, though, said their businesses were prepared.) Technology is a big reason for the change. The youngest people entering the work force don\u2019t remember a time when people weren\u2019t always reachable, so they don\u2019t see why they would need to sit in an office to work. (They also say they are more practiced than older colleagues at setting boundaries on how much they use their phones, so it doesn\u2019t become overbearing.) Another reason young people are asking for more flexibility is that they\u2019re marrying and having children later, so they\u2019re more invested in their careers by the time they do, and have more leverage to ask for what they need. Many are caring for aging parents too. Ali Levitan, 39, worked at a large media firm when she had her first child and decided to look for a new job. She wanted flexibility, but also to stay on her \u201cextremely ambitious\u201d career path. It was unwise to mention children in job interviews, she had been told. But once she had a job offer at General Assembly, an education company, she asked if she would be able to work from home most Fridays and pick up her child from school. They immediately agreed. \u201cI almost fell over at the response because that was not what I had experienced or expected,\u201d Ms. Levitan said. Demanding that employers treat employees well is part of the value system of the youngest generation of workers, which is the most diverse ever, researchers and recruiters say. \u201cGen Z is so socially aware and so progressive, they\u2019re asking for things that older generations have been scared to ask for,\u201d Ms. Recio at Salesforce said. Many have also seen their parents struggle with inflexible employers or unstable jobs. Millennials were the first generation raised by women who entered professions in big numbers. Many young adults saw their parents lose jobs and savings during the Great Recession. They no longer expect a lifetime of loyalty from an employer, so some say they don\u2019t want to give their whole life to work. \u201cThey\u2019ve watched what\u2019s happened to the generations before them and they see the problems that might come ahead,\u201d said Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University whose recent research on the topic will be published this month by the Council on Contemporary Families. \u201cAs the work force becomes more diverse, men as well as women are saying there\u2019s more to life than work, and we want a satisfying life as well.\u201d \u2018Change the System So We Can All Succeed\u2019Few people want to work long, inflexible hours, yet many either work them anyway or sneak out without asking for permission, research shows. But more young people, recruiters say, are asking for flexibility upfront, and some prioritize it over pay or seniority. Recruiters who visit college campuses say new graduates no longer see it as something to negotiate for, said Marcee Harris Schwartz, the national director of diversity and inclusion at BDO, the accounting firm: \u201cIt\u2019s just assumed it\u2019s part of the deal.\u201d \u201cYears ago, the interview was, for lack of a better word, a test,\u201d said Kamaj Bailey, who works in recruiting at Con Edison, the power company. \u201cNow it\u2019s a conversation. Yes, I want to show that I\u2019m a good candidate, but I\u2019m also seeing if I\u2019m going to get what I expect.\u201d John Paul Graff, 34, is a pathologist, as was his father, who worked in private practice at least 12 hours a day. Dr. Graff decided to work in academic medicine, and the No. 1 reason was for work-life balance. He estimated that he gave up about $100,000 a year but said it\u2019s worth it to work 40 hours a week. \u201cWhat we settled on was that the most important thing was time,\u201d Dr. Graff said. \u201cMoney will come, it will go, but you\u2019re only given so much time.\u201d A survey by Werk, which helps companies add flexibility strategies, found that older employees are just as likely as younger people to want flexibility. They\u2019re less likely to have it, though, because they\u2019re less likely to ask for it. Sometimes, tensions flare between young people who demand a life outside work and deskbound older workers. \u201cAs boomers age, they too are looking for more workplace flexibility, but they seem to begrudge giving the same to younger workers when they didn\u2019t have it themselves at their ages and life stage,\u201d said Pamela Stone, a sociologist at Hunter College. Ms. Coleman, who works at the design firm in Portland, said it comes down to this: The members of her generation are unwilling to settle for the way things have always been done. It\u2019s especially true of the women, she said, and she is hopeful that men will continue to join them. \u201cWe are just fed up and fired up about asking for what we need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the rules. We\u2019re the ones tasked with: Let\u2019s change the system so we can all succeed.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/women-poop-at-work.html", "title": "Women Poop. Sometimes At Work. Get Over It.", "summary": "", "authors": "By Jessica Bennett and Amanda McCall", "text": "There once was a woman who walked regularly from her office in Midtown Manhattan to a hotel across the street in order to use the restroom, and that woman may have been one of us.That woman had a friend, at another office job, who carried a book of matches and a can of air freshener in her purse \u2014 more willing to set off the office fire alarm than leave any hint of odor in a public lavatory.That friend had another friend, at another office job, who repeatedly forced her body to do the deed so quickly \u2014 racing from cubicle to bathroom and back, in an effort to deflect attention from what she might be doing in there \u2014 that it led to a semi-serious hemorrhoid problem.As her former colleague put it: \u201cShe was pooping at the speed of pee.\u201dRemember the children\u2019s book, \u201cEveryone Poops\u201d? It is meant to teach kids that defecating is a natural, healthy part of digestion, and it does so by illustrating a wide variety of creatures \u2014 dogs, cats, snakes, whales, hippos, little boys \u2014 happily defecating. But you know who you won\u2019t see defecating in that book, happily or unhappily? Women. [Read our full package, \u201cThe Office: An In-Depth Analysis of Workplace User Behavior.\u201d]We may be living in an age where certain pockets of the corporate world are breathlessly adapting to women\u2019s needs \u2014 company-subsidized tampons, salary workshops, lactation rooms. But even in the world\u2019s most progressive workplace, it\u2019s not a stretch to think that you might have an empowered female executive leading a meeting at one moment and then sneaking off to another floor to relieve herself, the next.Poop shame is real \u2014 and it disproportionately affects women, who suffer from higher rates of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In other words, the patriarchy has seeped into women\u2019s intestinal tracts. Let\u2019s call it the pootriarchy. Girls aren\u2019t born with poo shame \u2014 it\u2019s something they\u2019re taught.In \u201cPsychology in the Bathroom,\u201d the psychologist Nicholas Haslam writes that girls tend to be toilet trained earlier than boys, learning at a young age to neatly keep their bodily functions contained (our words, not his).When those girls get a bit older, they learn to pass gas silently \u2014 while boys do it loudly, and think it\u2019s hilarious. (Yes, there is a kind of Kinsey scale to gas-passing and it goes like this: According to a study called \u201cFecal Matters\u201d that was published in a journal called \u201cSocial Problems,\u201d adult heterosexual men are far more likely to engage in scatological humor than heterosexual women and are more likely to report intentionally passing gas. Gay men are less likely to intentionally pass gas than heterosexual women, and lesbian women are somewhere in between.)\u201cIf a boy farts, everyone laughs, including the boy,\u201d said Sarah Albee, the author of \u201cPoop Happened!: A History of the World from the Bottom Up.\u201d \u201cIf a girl farts, she is mortified.\u201dWhich is not to say that anxious poopers or audible flatulators of all genders don\u2019t exist: Indeed, a male friend of ours, a U.S. Marine, recently explained that he often changes out of his military uniform and into another while on base in order to enter an entirely different facility to use the restroom. (He was one of three individuals who responded to a survey we sent out to 100 people, mostly women, about fecal habits at work. Even with the cloak of anonymity, apparently nobody wanted to talk about it.)But while boys and men are more likely to develop \u201cparuresis,\u201d the D.S.M.-recognized medical term for pee-shyness \u2014 theorized by some to stem, in part, from the pressure of standing next to each other at open urinals \u2014 it is women who are more likely to have \u201cparcopresis,\u201d the corresponding bowel movement anxiety, which is not in the D.S.M., according to a variety of fecal scholars.\u201cThe bathroom is saturated with gender in fascinating ways,\u201d said Mr. Haslam, a professor of psychology at the University of Melbourne, who noted that women\u2019s aversion, particularly at work, is not entirely unfounded: One unpublished study he mentions in his book found that a woman who excused herself to go to the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to tend to \u201cpaperwork\u201d \u2014 while there was no difference in the way participants viewed the men.\u201cAt one level it\u2019s an association of women with purity,\u201d said Mr. Haslam, referring to the double standard. \u201cAt another it\u2019s a double standard applied to hygiene and civility, where the weight falls disproportionately on women to be clean, odorless and groomed.\u201dOr, as one of the woman interviewed in that \u201cFecal Matters\u201d study put it: \u201cWomen are supposed to be non-poopers.\u201dFor most of history, it would seem, they have fallen in line \u2014 adopting all sorts of creative ways to avoid mention, inference, acknowledgment, or God forbid, smell, even when inside the bathroom.According to Ms. Albee, in the Gold Rush days, while the men on the open range would simply find a shrub or pop a squat, prairie women would form elaborate protective circles to shield one another. \u201cThey\u2019d all stand in a circle, facing out, holding their skirts out to the side to form a \u2018wall,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen one at a time, they\u2019d take turns going to the bathroom in the middle of the circle, away from prying eyes.\u201dThese days, bathroom camouflage antics look far less sisterly. There are those who engage in the Flush Hush, which involves flushing the toilet over and over again to drown out any sound. There is the Scatological Standoff, in which two or more women sit silently in stalls next to one another, waiting for one to break the silence and have a bowel movement first \u2014 or simply give up and retreat back to their cubicle, only to begin the same standoff an hour later. And then there\u2019s the Poop Dupe \u2014 when you walk into the bathroom, see a co-worker you know, and immediately beeline to the mirror to check your hair. (Because you\u2019d rather be known as superficial than defecating, obviously.)Or maybe you just hold it. According to a recent survey of 1,000 Canadian women, 71 percent said they go \u201cto great lengths to avoid defecating \u2014 especially in a public washroom.\u201d (Is it any surprise to hear that women are more constipated than men?)Historians have long noted that public facilities were created for \u2014 and built by \u2014 men, and bathrooms are no exception. Most architects are men, most plumbers are men, and early public facilities were tailored to the white men \u2014 and then later, white women \u2014 who were engaging in public life enough to use them. Which might help explain why nobody stopped to think that just because the square footage of a bathroom facility may be equal, that doesn\u2019t mean you can necessarily fit an equal number of stalls. Men\u2019s room users have the luxury of urinals and speed, while women \u2014 who must contend with things like periods, changing-tables, one-piece rompers and wiping \u2014 take longer to use the restroom, while doing so with less real estate.In Congress, women didn\u2019t have their own bathrooms on the House floor until 2011 (2011! When there were 76 of them serving!) while those in the Senate got theirs off the Senate floor in 1993. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the five minutes to get\u201d to the restroom \u201cand then the five minutes to get back,\u201d Rep. Donna F. Edwards (D-Md.), told the Washington Post in 2011. \u201cI would have missed a vote.\u201dPreviously, those female House members had to trek out of chambers and fight off tourists in another hall \u2014 a scene that reminded us of \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d the film about the early black women scientists of NASA, who had to hike half a mile to the closest segregated women\u2019s restroom to relieve themselves. The scene may have been fictional, but suffice to say, women of color have had to endure much worse.And then there are the biological factors at play.According to the work of Dr. Robynne Chutkan, an integrative gastroenterologist and the author of \u201cGutbliss,\u201d women\u2019s poop anxiety might not simply be cultural or even psychological. It could be physical, as there are actually some profound differences between the female and male digestive tracts, beginning with the length of the colon, which is longer in women (Dr. Chutkan calls it the \u201cvoluptuous Venus\u201d).\u201cWhat that extra length in the colon does is create this redundancy, these sort of extra twists and turns,\u201d she has said. \u201cThink of the male colon as kind of a gentle horseshoe, and the female colon as being a tangled-up Slinky.\u201dAs it turns out, the ideal position for a person to comfortably relieve their bowels \u2014 at least according to gastroenterologists \u2014 is a lot like a squat, with the knees at a 90-degree angle to the waist, and not a seated position. Which means that perhaps all of us should be investing in a squatty potty to prop up our feet, but particularly those of us with a tangled up Slinky for a colon, sitting on a toilet in an office building that was built for the height of men.Or, a better idea: We could invest in educating girls to accept their bodies as they are, along with all the smells and sounds that come with it. Because, quite frankly, women have enough crap to deal with.Jessica Bennett writes on gender and culture, and is pretty sure this is not the type of writing her parents expected when she told them she\u2019d taken a job at The New York Times.Amanda McCall is a writer, producer and co-author of the book \u201cGrandma\u2019s Dead: Breaking Bad News With Baby Animals.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/the-awkward-art-of-office-small-talk.html", "title": "The Awkward but Essential Art of Office Chitchat", "summary": "", "authors": "By Lindsay Mannering", "text": "Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there.Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you\u2019re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow!If these strategies sound familiar, if you\u2019ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something \u201cdumb\u201d or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything.[Read our full package, \u201cThe Office: An In-Depth Analysis of Workplace User Behavior.\u201d]Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. \u201cRapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we\u2019re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you\u2019re in.\u201dBuilding rapport applies when you\u2019re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who\u2019s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression.But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we\u2019re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch.Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we\u2019re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login.Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling.Remember: You\u2019re More Likable Than You ThinkA 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people \u201csystematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.\u201dThink about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it\u2019s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, \u201cWow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist\u201d? No. You go back to your desk and think, \u201cWow, I\u2019m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.\u201d And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself. Point is, you\u2019re more likable than you think you are, so try not to judge yourself so harshly. According to Ellie Hearne, founder and C.E.O. of the leadership communications agency Pencil or Ink, which, among other services, teaches companies and executives how to have better internal communications, \u201cpeople don\u2019t remember what you say \u2014 they remember how they felt when they were with you.\u201dA Little Planning Goes a Long WayIf you\u2019re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull.\u201cWhether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cTopics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.\u201d Did something weird or interesting happen to you recently? Workshop (in your mind, at least) that story ahead of time to unveil at your next office outing.And definitely remember to ask questions. We\u2019re all ultimately pretty narcissistic at heart. Advance the Dreaded \u201cHow Are You?\u201d LoopThe ping-pong of \u201cHow are you? Good, how are you?\u201d can feel like a waste of time and energy, but be the change you wish to see in the world and break the cycle. Go to your inner Rolodex of topics (see: planning ahead) and move the short conversation forward by replying why you\u2019re \u201cgood.\u201d As in, \u201cI\u2019m good. I just started a book/podcast/TV show and I\u2019m really enjoying it. Have you heard of it?\u201d Or mention something office-related, where there\u2019s a shared common experience: \u201cI\u2019m good. They restocked the cold brew in the kitchen and it\u2019s so strong. Have you tried it?\u201d Don\u2019t Panic, It\u2019s Almost OverSmall talk doesn\u2019t last long. \u201cIf you\u2019re a generally anxious person, you have an out \u2014 you\u2019re at work! You\u2019re not supposed to spend too much time chatting. After a few moments you can reference a meeting or project you are supposed to work on,\u201d Ms. Terran advised. A simple exchange of pleasantries followed by a concise but polite exit (\u201cHave a good day!\u201d) is perfectly acceptable. You (Occasionally) Have the Right to Remain SilentIf you\u2019re having a bad day and don\u2019t want to talk, that might be best for everyone involved. Enter headphones. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to take a step back from engaging. Most people know the new workplace etiquette, \u00e0 la earbuds in means \u2018give me some space,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hearne said. A simple smile or nod to acknowledge your co-worker will still go a long way.I\u2019ll leave you with a warning: There are very few ways to have successful small talk in the office bathroom. It should go without saying that attempting to chat with someone while they\u2019re in the bathroom stall is totally off-limits. That said, one of the more memorable (in a good way) office chitchats I\u2019ve ever had happened at the bathroom sink. A co-worker who was clearly excellent at storing away fun facts and sharing them appropriately told me about the \u201cshake and fold\u201d method of using a paper towel to decrease waste. I have used the method, and used it as a small talk device, ever since.Lindsay Mannering was a founding team member of Bustle.com and writes from Brooklyn, NY."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/moes-cinnabon-focus-brands.html", "title": "They Are What You Eat", "summary": "", "authors": "By Caity Weaver", "text": "In a 1780 letter to his wife, Abigail, John Adams proposed a chronology of generational obligations for learning.

And now when you go into schools at whatever level, it\u2019s much more collaborative and solution oriented. And that, I think, has led to some of the evolution you see in the workplace and how people are taught to interact with each other and work and problem solve across industries.\u201d A Montessori office.What did Focus\u2019s millennial advisers call for in the workplace of their dreams?

Research on the merits of open offices is mixed. Gensler company literature suggests a majority of \u201cknowledge workers\u201d prefer \u201csome sort of\u201d open plan, while some studies have found that open offices imperil employees\u2019 job satisfaction, musculoskeletal health and \u201cpsychological privacy.\u201d Whether for good or for ill, they are prevalent. Proponents cite their shared, common windows as a major advantage over cubicle warrens. These airy, symmetrical, light-and-glass-filled spaces that stretch to the near horizon are indeed beautiful, in much the same way the ninth floor of the Asch building in Manhattan \u2014 its large windows casting luxuriant light onto its open work area from their generous southern exposure \u2014 was beautiful, until the afternoon of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. This is not to imply that the Focus offices, which conduct regular fire and shelter-in-place drills, are in any way unsafe, merely that they provide the kind of dreamy access to natural light that designers have pursued for centuries. Nor is it intended to portend ill for, or in any way curse, the work force of Focus, a presumably representative sample of whom were, on a recent visit, welcoming, good-humored, eager to share knowledge and friendly. Nor is that intended to imply Triangle seamstresses lacked such qualities.ImageCredit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York TimesImageCredit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York TimesAt Focus, most work spaces are structured around so-called bench seating, where employees are seated on chairs at long communal tables, with individual spaces demarcated by low partitions. Singular features abound on the premises, like the thousands of little glass balls that hang from what looks like threads of the finest spider\u2019s silk, arranged into the word \u201cFOCUS\u201d on the executive floor. Then there are the test kitchens. Here, on a recent Wednesday morning, Cinnabon\u2019s lab-coat-clad executive chef Jennifer Holwill, 41, scrutinized smears of caramel spread before her on parchment paper for purposes related to \u201crisk management.\u201d (The risk: a DEFCON 2 scenario wherein Cinnabon\u2019s caramel manufacturer would be rendered unable to produce the vast quantities of caramel required to satiate a nation.) It is in these miniature commercial kitchens that new products are researched and designed (with the notable exception of menu items from Auntie Anne\u2019s, whose test kitchen and creative facilities are based out of a historic former post office in Lancaster, Pa., for reasons that seem largely to hinge on the undeniably accurate tautology that Auntie Anne\u2019s is \u201ca Pennsylvania-based company\u201d). ImageThe chefs Brenda McGranahan, left, and Jennifer Holwill work in the research and development test kitchen at the Focus headquarters.\u00a0Credit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York TimesIt is here where a limited-time offering like a Cinnabon Churro Frosting Sandwich can be tweaked to such perfection that the Dr. Frankensteins who created it are left with no choice but to prolong its life indefinitely, incorporating it into menus as a permanent feature. Ms. Holwill said that colleagues have offered to buy fresh-baked samples from her \u2014 verboten, as test kitchen chefs are only allowed to offer samples (should they care to offer samples) first come first served. (The nearest location where Cinnabon MiniBons can be legally and ethically purchased by employees is a mall roughly 15 minutes away.) But because it is 2019, some of the most urgent work in the building is done by the social teams. A major force of Focus public relations is Marissa Sharpless, a virtuosically engaging senior manager of social media and P.R. for Cinnabon who, speaking off the cuff, paints a brand picture of such depth and volume that it rivals any by Caravaggio. Mrs. Sharpless, 34, can keep watch over Focus\u2019s byzantine, constantly updating social channels on the building\u2019s ground floor, where a wall-mounted TV displays social interactions. It is possible here to observe in real time as people direct their ire, daydreams and profane, improbable questions @JambaJuice, @Schlotzskys, @AuntieAnnes. ImageThis is not a restaurant.Credit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York TimesThrough a deft series of clicks, Mrs. Sharpless summoned a page of graphics onto her laptop screen. Here was the world\u2019s collected knowledge (or at least articulated Twitter observations) about Cinnabon over the past month, broken down into hashtags, emoji clouds, choropleth maps of the United States, pie charts, bar graphs, line graphs and days of the week (Cinnabon typically \u201cpops\u201d on Tuesdays). There was also some kind of something where purple was supposed to stay high because purple was sentiment and, said Mrs. Sharpless, a rise in conversation coupled with a drop in sentiment is \u201cthe last thing you want to see.\u201dThe top emojis people had felt about Cinnabon were crying laughing, sobbing, heart eyes and anguished. Words and phrases were assigned a color: green for positive emotions (\u201ccrave\u201d), red for negative ones (\u201cnot that great\u201d).ImageThe unbreakable cipher.Credit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York TimesUpstairs, Robby Ayala, 28, a social media manager for Moe\u2019s Southwest Grill, maintains the brand\u2019s Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts. He said the most difficult aspect of his job was coming up with unique content about Moe\u2019s every day.\u201cI try to tweet once a day. That\u2019s a lot more challenging than it sounds,\u201d he said, and laughed.The difficulty isn\u2019t in coming up with an appealingly irreverent tweet to share with fans of Moe\u2019s (a task many could likely accomplish) but in thinking of another one the next day, and another the day after that, and another the day after that, hundreds \u2014 potentially thousands \u2014 of times in a row, without repeating or embarrassing yourself.\u201cIf you jump in inappropriately, you will get roasted,\u201d he said, reflecting on the recent Twitter storm over Popeyes\u2019 Spicy Chicken Sandwich. \u201cLike Zaxby\u2019s jumped in, they got roasted. Boston Market jumped in. Chick-fil-A took a lot of L\u2019s.\u201dMr. Ayala\u2019s job is, essentially, to talk about Moe\u2019s in a brief, hilarious and charming way, without stopping, forever. He found delirious success one day this summer when his tweet combining a meme about aliens in Area 51 with the very notion of Moe\u2019s burritos received roughly 2,100 retweets. But then he had to tweet again.Maintaining the high corporate standards of some of America\u2019s iconic snack foods in 2019 demands stamina, adrenaline, a commitment to unironically observing National Lemonade Day, high levels of organization and good cheer. It also requires a willingness to work in a space bursting with digital screens, where, for the general population, all but the most essential walls have been eliminated, and the resulting din camouflaged with pink noise pumped in from ceiling speakers \u2014 which is to say, it\u2019s not for everyone.In his own office, Mr. DeSutter recalled one worker who, years ago, faced with the impending renovation, \u201csaid, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be able to work in this environment,\u2019 and they left.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only staff member with reservations.

I say, just deal with it. I had a younger sister who committed suicide at 29. I\u2019ve wondered, what was it that made her feel that death was easier to bear than life?

I packed a couple of cashmere blazers for the stay, but we\u2019ve been here so long that the seasons have changed. I\u2019m in my studio right now, looking through the French doors at a wraparound porch and a beautiful katsura tree. I\u2019m here with my husband, Michael Cominotto. It\u2019s been quiet.And stress free?Michael and I have never been together day and night for 50-plus days. There have been a few tight moments, but we\u2019re in a house with a big garden. I don\u2019t know if I could have done this in our Manhattan apartment.How do you keep up with work?I\u2019m on Zoom and working with my QVC team. For QVC we do an entire collection. My clients are buying outerwear. It lifts me up that gals have hope that one day this is going to end. The dining room is where I film for QVC. The library has become the design studio for our Madison Avenue store. We\u2019re waiting to find out what fashion week will be.What do you think that will look like?Maybe we\u2019ll all be showing in our studio. Maybe the presentations will be more like the old collections in Paris, shown to a few people at a time.Does anything make you nostalgic?We\u2019ve had dinners in Water Mill for 60 or 70 people. That\u2019s something I\u2019m missing more than restaurants right now. I have a large collection of china, silver, crystal \u2014 that\u2019s my passion.

What took you to Vail?I was with my husband [Oscar Tang, the philanthropist and business leader], hoping to get in some skiing. We were there for one day before they shut down all the slopes. It became a ghost town overnight. But we would go on hikes and see a baby moose walking around. She was here for a week, sometimes on our front grass.What\u2019s been the downside of this crisis for you?I\u2019ve always loved traveling. I miss that now. And since we\u2019ve been quarantined, I\u2019ve felt so helpless reading about what was happening in New York.How have you coped?I\u2019ve been working with Louise Mirrer of the New-York Historical Society to get medical supplies to hospitals in Queens and Brooklyn \u2014 those public hospitals where the nurses were wearing trash bags and doctors were calling us begging for masks. In Vail I drove around to every hardware store and every market buying up masks and gloves to send to New York. We own several boutique hotels around the world and have gotten them to send supplies, too.Have you found other ways of giving back?I\u2019m executive chair of the Asia Society Museum Triennial, so I\u2019ve been focused on that. Our work on the event, which has been moved to October and will run through the following June, is especially vital at a time when racism against Asians and Asian-Americans has resurged. We will have an exhibition addressing that. It keeps me working 12-hour days.How do you imagine your life post-Covid?This is going to sound totally nerdy, but once upon a time I studied to be an opera singer.

New York sounded pretty apocalyptic at the time, so we\u2019re grateful just to have nature.You have a home in Brooklyn. Has country living altered your routines?Most of the content that I create and share is within my home, so in a sense my day-to-day hasn\u2019t changed. But what I communicate has vastly changed. Instead of just offering recipes, for example, I\u2019m trying to share ideas about how to buy ingredients that can last.Has self-seclusion taken an emotional toll?I\u2019m not feeling as productive as I\u2019d like to be. I keep starting things and not finishing them. Maybe I need structure, or maybe I\u2019m just adapting to a new normal. Most days I make sure to get out of my sweatpants and brush my teeth. But some days it\u2019s 4 o\u2019clock and I haven\u2019t done either.Have other habits suffered?I\u2019ve been eating crunchy cheese doodles, Frosted Flakes. I\u2019m supposed to be this healthy seasonal eater, but I want the comfort of childhood right now.What\u2019s been the upside for you?In Brooklyn our son, Jivan, is in his room all the time. For us, this has been a great time to play board games, laugh and reconnect. Thankfully, we\u2019re not at each other\u2019s throats.Have you found ways to focus outside home?My dad is in the hospital. I\u2019m using my own sadness to act on things related to our struggle. I\u2019ve donated to Invisible Hands, a group created by four college kids to get food to people who need it, and to Meals on Wheels.

What brought you on board?When it was pointed out to me that L.G.B.T.Q. youth centers were shutting down or being defunded during the Covid crisis, I jumped in. A shutdown means that kids and teenagers are being forced to self-isolate with their families in their home. A lot of those teenagers don\u2019t necessarily feel safe in their home.Do you relate to that experience?I grew up in New York with very liberal, gay-friendly parents. I only experienced homophobia for first time in my life in my 20s in Hollywood. But so much of what\u2019s on television can give a false impression that coming out of the closet is the easiest thing to do, that families will greet you with open arms. That\u2019s a myth.The gala drew a high-profile crowd, supporters like Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Pete and Chasten Buttigieg, Billy Porter and Jonathan Van Ness. Was it glamorous?To be honest, there is nothing very glamorous about Zoom. I do think including entertainers at these events helps the message go down a little easier.Did it do that for you?I got to chat with Dan Levy, Adam Lambert and my friend Matt Bomer. We\u2019d never gotten to talk before about what inspired him to come out. As an actor, that\u2019s still a challenge.Have you found other positive distractions?Fun is relative these days. I was couple of weeks away from filming a movie I co-wrote and am starring in, that Judd Apatow is producing. It\u2019s a romantic comedy about two gay men. We were literally packing our bags to start shooting. Now that\u2019s on hold. But I realized there are much bigger problems than shooting a movie right now.ImageLizzie Asher, center, and Christina DeLeon at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum gala in 2018.Credit...Rebecca Smeyne for The New York TimesLizzie AsherAge: 37Occupation: president, Macchu Pisco, a beverage companyFavorite Charities: Cura Collective, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Save Venice, World Global Kitchen, City SquashWhere are you hunkering down?

I wake up to my little guy \u2014 he is 6 \u2014 crawling into my bed for a snuggle. My husband works from home, so afterward he settles in to work. I do two home schooling sessions with my son every day.Have you found ways to vary that routine?We all have lunch together. Later, rain or shine, we do a family run along the West Side Highway as a way for us to let out pent-up energy. I\u2019m growing herbs in wooden boxes at my kitchen window. Before we went into self-isolation I had ordered seeds from Amazon and worms. I\u2019m composting at home. I make juice for the family from those herbs.What is your way of giving back?I\u2019m on the patient advisory board at Columbia Presbyterian hospital, where I was treated some years back for a pulmonary embolism that led to a coma. As part of the Cura Collective, which I founded with friends, we are donating beauty and grooming products to the I.C.U. units and hospital staff. I put my little one in the back seat of the car, and we make the deliveries.What things are you missing from pre-Covid days?It would be really overwhelming to be taking stock of all the things we\u2019re missing. I try to enjoy things, no matter how small \u2014 that\u2019s something I learned coming out of my coma. At a time like this, having your health is priceless.ImageAndrew Saffir with Helena Christensen, center, and Camilla Staerk at a Cinema Society party atOmar\u2019s La Boite in December.Credit...Rebecca Smeyne for The New York TimesAndrew SaffirAge: 53Occupation: founder of the Cinema Society, which holds red-carpet movie screenings.Favorite Charity: City HarvestWhere are you hunkering down?East Hampton, New York.What is a typical day for you now?I\u2019m keeping up with the newspaper and CNN online, and managing an adapted work schedule. That means strategizing on film screenings in the absence of theaters and with most release dates still unknown.How are you spending your downtime?Daniel [Benedict, his partner] and I rarely had a night in to watch TV before. But we\u2019ve now devoured \u201cBroadchurch,\u201d \u201cThe Tunnel\u201d and, because we need some levity, \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cDerry Girls.\u201dI\u2019m making my way through A.F.I.\u2019s 100 Greatest American Films of All Time (ciao, Don Corleone!). I\u2019m bingeing on a British mystery series, and Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers for a therapeutic laugh. Also, I grew up eating out most every night, so eating at home nightly is \u2026 different. Thomas Keller I am not.Which charities have you been supporting?I procured some of the celebrity lineup for the City Harvest Foodathon. We asked people to do a video telling what they love about New York. Everyone instantly said yes and sent the most touching stories. Some, like Judith Light, who paid homage to those on the front lines, brought tears to my eyes.What are you missing most?Daniel and I had tickets to three shows when everything closed, including the first preview of \u201cPlaza Suite.\u201d We can\u2019t wait to cheer on Sarah Jessica, Matthew and John Hickey, when that curtain finally rises.

So we tried to come up with a creative solution to replicate the sense of a charity event.Can you describe it? We introduced the first ever Zoom gala.

Malibu, Calif.Have you evolved a daily routine? When things seemed dicey in New York, I sent my children to Malibu. I flew out to be with them 10 days ago. At first it was chaos, but we\u2019ve set up a little schoolhouse, a room with a whiteboard and iPads, where the girls (they\u2019re 4, 9 and 11) can study. Our babysitter, who is living with us, handles the lessons. We\u2019re not all cut out to be math teachers (laughs).What\u2019s your advice for parents trying to keep up a semblance of order and sanity? It\u2019s important to take an hour in the morning to work out, or just think. When you\u2019re not used to being with your children 24-7, you\u2019re going to need that early morning downtime.What about work? We\u2019ve set up a mini office in our house. It\u2019s tricky, but everyone is on mobile videoconferencing apps so we can have marketing, budget and design discussions. We have to get our samples done. There is no retail now, but your business really can\u2019t stop.How do you keep up your charitable giving? I\u2019m working with No Kid Hungry. We\u2019ve donated 10 percent of our online sales to support working moms and supply meals to the millions of children who would otherwise be relying on schools for their lunch.What tweaks have you made in your socializing? We have Zoom dinner parties. Everyone sits down with their iPad or phone and a glass of wine. We all laugh. Sure, there are glitches. Some of us look kind of blurry onscreen. Who cares?Are you feeling nostalgic for your New York life? I miss passing the deli on my morning walks, with all the colorful flowers out front. It\u2019s the little things that you took for granted that you\u2019re reminded to appreciate in the future.And I miss dressing up. Sometimes I just stare at my beautiful racks of clothes.

I made beef stroganoff last night and shrimp scampi the night before. We\u2019re a little competitive, but we also inspire each other. We\u2019re longing for a little scratch-and-sniff app on our phones.What do you miss the most? I miss just a handful of friends, and especially my monthly dinners with my best friend Chappy [Morris] at table 12 at the Carlyle \u2014 a little pocket of civilization in Manhattan.How about the parties? I don\u2019t miss the big charity parties. I do think it will be revelatory in the next couple of months to see who will still be supporting these causes, now that their pictures are not being published.What are some pet peeves? There are people who actually brag about the way they\u2019re distancing themselves from their housekeepers or trainers, like that\u2019s a badge of honor. This kind of crisis puts a magnifying glass on who we really are.How are you keeping your spirits up? I\u2019m fostering an old cat. He\u2019s called Bear, because he\u2019s big and black like a bear. Serena and I found him on the Animal Rescue Fund van that comes around from time to time. Seeing him propped inside in a corner really was a heart tugger. There are so many older animals that no one is going to adopt. They need a home.Drinking for me is a purely social sport, so I\u2019m having an inadvertent dry spell.

Doing these ordinary things can make a huge difference. I find myself checking in by phone with friends and family and people I\u2019ve been out of touch with for a while. We take Bird, our little cockapoo, for walks. She normally has a strict routine.

Not bad, but still not fast enough to feed the school\u2019s 2,700 students in the rush between classes.So Ms. Vuksta, Furman\u2019s director of auxiliary services, has added two grab-and-go meal stations (one that can accommodate 60 students per hour and another that can handle 180). She also plans a pop-up restaurant outside the main library that will serve street food from around the world, for students and especially staff and faculty, who as a safety precaution will not be allowed to visit the main dining hall.The number of students that can be served per minute is not a normal concern for college and university dining administrators, who in recent years have tried to distinguish themselves on the quality and variety of their food, and the sense of community that it can bring to a campus. Over the last decade, the food served in college cafeterias has transformed from the butt of jokes into a major perk; the dining hall is often the first stop on campus tours.Because of the coronavirus, however, nothing about this year is going to be normal. At campuses across the country, self-serve stations, where students can make their own salads or taco bowls, will be eliminated; instead, masked-and-gloved workers, shielded by plexiglass barriers, will serve nearly everything. Gone, too, will be condiment and coffee stations, replaced by single-serving ketchup and salad-dressing packets and paper cups that many schools were triumphantly phasing out in an effort to reduce waste. Several universities are even using robots prepare food and deliver it.At Furman, where students will return to campus for the fall semester on Aug. 18, Ms. Vuksta plans to offer insulated, reusable grocery bags so students can carry out multiple to-go meals, and is considering adding picnic tables for outdoor eating.But the only thing that is sure is that plans will change. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to read a crystal ball and the fact is no one knows how this is going to pan out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can be stressful.\u201dImageLois Leino, a human resources assistant with Bon App\u00e9tit Management Company, with food at Furman University, which is planning several different ways to feed students on campus in the fall.Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesAt the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Garett DiStefano, the director of dining services, is bracing for what is surely the strangest-ever back-to-school. On June 29, the university announced that nearly all classes will be held virtually, though students may return to live on campus if they choose.For those who return, dining halls and food courts will continue to offer dishes for students on special diets. But customization is expected to be a victim of the coronavirus. Salad bars will have fewer choices to keep the lines moving. At the make-your-own ramen station, bowls will be premade.Mr. DiStefano emphasized that while the biggest changes will be seen in traditional dining halls, they are only one part of the college food experience. For example, the university operates two food trucks and a mobile kitchen, from which it serves favorites like burgers and grilled cheese. He plans to expand those menus and create additional options, like a falafel bar, served under a tent outdoors.\u201cThere are things we can do that are quick and fun and still create an experience, but in a different, safe way,\u201d he said.ImageIt is unclear what campus life will look like at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the fall, but mealtime will be dramatically altered.Credit...Adam Glanzman for The New York TimesThings will be different in the kitchen, too. Masks and gloves will be mandatory everywhere, and many schools, including Rice University in Houston, are mandating temperature checks for workers and reducing the number of staff members in the kitchen.At Rice, those numbers have been cut in half to allow for social distancing. Sodexo, the food service giant that operates at some 600 campuses in the United States, has created a training module called the Six Foot Kitchen, which provides guidance on how to create safe kitchen environments \u2014 everything from tape marks on the floor to mark safe distances, to protocols for accepting deliveries and managing storage.Sodexo is also turning to technology for help. At two of the universities it works with, the company has robots ready to deliver food to students outside dining halls and food courts.George Mason University, in Fairfax, Va., is one of those schools. When its 36,000 students head back to school on Aug. 24, Sodexo will have 43 robots \u2014 essentially high-tech coolers on wheels \u2014 ready to deliver meals and snacks from Starbucks, Dunkin\u2019 and other brands. Students order via an app, food workers load the order into the robot, then the robot drives itself to the appointed location, whether that\u2019s a dorm or a bench near the library.Last fall, Sodexo filled more than 25,000 orders this way at George Mason. Jeff McKinley, a Sodexo district manager who works with the school, expects that number to grow as the robots eliminate the need for students to enter a busy food court. \u201cRobots are definitely part of our safe reopening plan,\u201d he said.ImageAt George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., students will be able to order Starbucks and have their coffee delivered via robot.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesImageThe fleet of robots can meet students at locations all over campus.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesBon App\u00e9tit Management Company, a food service firm operating at more than 100 campuses, including Furman, Reed College in Portland, Ore., the University of Chicago and M.I.T., is also using robots, but in the kitchen.Before the pandemic, Bon App\u00e9tit had installed robots on campuses across the country, including Blendid robots to make custom smoothies; \u201cSally,\u201d a robot that whips up made-to-order salads; and a so-called pizza A.T.M., which can serve up a hot pie in three minutes. But what was seen as fun and futuristic, a spokeswoman for the company said, is now being looked at as a way to reduce pressure on employees who will be busier than ever with additional serving duties and constant cleaning.Maisie Ganzler, Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s chief strategy and brand officer, has been overseeing these transitions since campuses shut down in March. Her first task was to become an expert in various types of personal protective equipment, and where to obtain them. She has spent the last few months investigating new types of equipment, such as no-touch coffee urns, and all manner of sustainable packaging.Ms. Ganzler said the physical and safety changes are the easier parts of the shift. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about putting food into a portioned cup. What we can\u2019t lose sight of is the fundamental thing that food delivers on college campuses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of \u2018adulting,\u2019 where kids learn to make their own food choices or express their identity through food. How we achieve all that within the restrictions is a more interesting question than whether you will have prewrapped silverware.\u201dTo that end, Bon App\u00e9tit dining managers are continuing to emphasize hospitality \u2014 signs at service stations read \u201cAllow us to serve you,\u201d rather than an alternative such as \u201cNo mask. No Service\u201d \u2014 and offering online programming. Butler University in Indianapolis has devised food trivia contests, and at Washington University in St. Louis, a chef has offered virtual cooking demos for dishes like mushroom risotto.ImagePlexiglass dividers will be a fixture in many campus dining halls this fall, including at Furman.Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesEthan Hodge, a 21-year-old Asian studies major at Furman, has already seen several iterations of what college food might look like in the age of the coronavirus. Unlike most students, Mr. Hodge did not leave campus this spring because his family is homeless and his college apartment was the safest place for him to be.For the first few weeks, he and the roughly 80 other students remaining picked up prepared meals at the dining hall. As numbers dwindled, the kitchen began delivering reheatable meals and meal kits, complete with detailed instructions. By June, dining services had switched it up again, allowing Mr. Hodge and other students to order groceries from an online list so they could cook themselves.\u201cIt was by far the best decision they could have made to keep us safe and keep us healthy,\u201d Mr. Hodge said. \u201cA busy dining hall is something the Furman community is going to miss. It\u2019s what makes us able to meet people from other places and learn about them. It\u2019s the whole liberal arts experience.\u201cI know dining services is going to do what\u2019s best,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the students being safe that I\u2019m worried about.\u201dFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

I love beans, in fact. And lately I have had vegetarian burgers on the brain.Perhaps it has something to do with sitting outdoors on a recent warm summer evening, as lighter fluid perfumed the neighborhood, followed by the acrid smoky aroma of beef fat dripping on glowing charcoal briquettes. It didn\u2019t make me crave red meat.Though I do appreciate the occasional burger with all the trimmings, a big pile of fries and an ice-cold beer, my dinners at home have been largely vegetarian of late.But I wasn\u2019t after the handcrafted veggie burger you\u2019ve seen in food magazines, photographed to look not just like a burger, but the best-looking burger you\u2019ve ever seen. Big, beautiful, bodacious and juicy \u2014 the classic here\u2019s-a-gorgeous-burger-that-even-carnivores-would-like.That kind of patty has heft and color and nuts and grains, grated carrots and beets, designed to have a meatlike \u201cmouthfeel.\u201d You could get anyone to eat it without much coaxing.I envisioned a homely black bean burger that wasn\u2019t like that at all. I wanted it to taste like really good Mexican refried beans.I planned to emphasize, not disguise, the black beans in the mixture, and I definitely did not want to add bread crumbs or filler to make it firm. I wanted it to be highly seasoned, with cumin, cilantro, scallions, green chile and piment\u00f3n. I didn\u2019t care if it could be grilled. Of course I didn\u2019t want it mushy, either, but cooked beans by their very nature are not meant to be chewy.For body, I added cooked brown rice, which seemed a compatible choice. I hand-mashed the mixture for maximum texture. To bind, I used cornstarch and egg. Then I dusted the patties on both sides with fine cornmeal and pan-fried them.To me, this was an extremely delicious burger \u2014 tender, with a pleasantly crisp exterior.Suddenly it occurred to me that a fried egg on top would be a nice addition. In France, when a beef burger is topped with an egg, it\u2019s called \u00e0 cheval (on horseback), so the idea isn\u2019t without precedent.Well, when those two got together in a toasted bun, they made a heavenly combination. It was like a great fried egg sandwich and the best black-bean patty, both on the same bill. So I wrote the recipe that way. There would be Mexican-style jalape\u00f1o pickles on the side. A big chopped salad, too. And for dessert, strawberry-coconut ice cream made into a cake. Here was a fine vegetarian picnic for staying at home, inside or out.ImageCredit...Andrew Scrivani for The New York TimesBlack Bean Burger With an Egg on TopThis is a vegetarian burger that does not mimic the texture or look of ground meat, but it isn\u2019t meant to. It\u2019s more like deluxe refried beans. Though you can serve this well-seasoned patty like a traditional burger, on a bun with the usual condiments, it is at its best topped with a fried egg. Dusted with fine cornmeal, the burgers are pan-fried as the mixture is too soft to grill. They may be seared in advance and reheated in the oven until crisp.ImageCredit...Andrew Scrivani for The New York TimesJalape\u00f1o PicklesThese medium-spicy pickles, versions of which can be found throughout Mexico and Central America, make a perfect garnish for burgers, tacos or sandwiches, or they may be served with drinks. They are often made only with jalape\u00f1os, plus a little onion and carrot. Jalape\u00f1os vary in heat: Some are very spicy, some not. If you wish to make the pickles spicier, add a few serrano chiles, split lengthwise.ImageCredit...Andrew Scrivani for The New York TimesChopped Cucumber and Tomato SaladHere\u2019s an easy summer salad that\u2019s always a winner. There are many similar chopped salads served throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, but this version with halved sweet cherry tomatoes is especially attractive. Your own take can be a variation on this one: Feel free to use large tomatoes, chop the vegetables as small or large as you like (roughly chopped has its charms), add other herbs like basil, mint or dill, or swap the feta for mozzarella.ImageCredit...Andrew Scrivani for The New York TimesStrawberry-Coconut Ice Cream CakeThis is an impressive dessert to serve, showered with toasted coconut and adorned with berries. Use sweet, ripe summer berries from a farm stand for the best flavor \u2014 they should really smell like strawberries. Whipped cream, coconut milk and a touch of vodka help keep the mixture from forming ice crystals. It should ideally be served within 24 hours for the best texture.And to Drink \u2026Vegetable-based burgers like this one tend to replace the tang of beef with a heavy dose of umami. For the combination of black beans and brown rice that gives this burger its heft, we can go in two directions. First would be a fresh, lively red, with plenty of acidity and few tannins, the kind of red that benefits from a slight chill. A lot of wines fit this description, beginning with the original vins de soif, Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages. I would also be happy with the many thirst-quenching reds, made all over the world from myriad grapes, some of which are called natural wines. The other option would be a so-called orange wine, whites produced using the technique for making reds. These are generally amber in color, with a mild rasp of tannin and often go well with umami-rich dishes.

Her parents made sure to cook with familiar flavors, to keep memories alive.As an adult, the 42-year-old special education kindergarten teacher, who lives in the Inwood area of Manhattan, found those same tastes through the same Goya Foods products.\u201cGoya is the one product that I know that my family used, that my mom still uses,\u201d Ms. Baez-Rosario said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the one that resembles home to them.\u201dOn Thursday, though, she decided she would not be buying Goya products again after the company\u2019s president, Robert Unanue, praised President Trump during a visit to the White House.Mr. Unanue compared the president to his grandfather, an immigrant from Spain who founded the food company in 1936. \u201cWe\u2019re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump,\u201d Mr. Unanue said.After Mr. Unanue\u2019s comments, consumers have been dumping out ingredients and calling for a boycott on social media with the hashtags #BoycottGoya, #GoyaFoods and #Goyaway. Prominent Latino politicians like Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former presidential candidate and secretary of housing and urban development, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighed in as well.\u201cIf we are the main source of income, if you are targeting us and you are marketing toward us, then your responsibility is to every Latino person, at least in the United States,\u201d Ms. Baez-Rosario said.In an era of activist shopping, when consumers are ever more vocal about tying their purchasing power to their politics, Mr. Unanue\u2019s comments run the risk of alienating his company\u2019s core market.\u201cThere are people out there that say they support the immigrant community, but at the end, money is stronger,\u201d said Gonzalo Guzm\u00e1n, 38, the head chef and a partner at Nopalito, a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco. \u201cAt the end, it\u2019s always that. It\u2019s always money.\u201dA Goya representative did not reply to specific questions about the controversy. But in a news release, the company pointed out that it has donated 1 million cans of chickpeas and 1 million pounds of other products to food banks across the nation. \u201cWe are committed to our country and the need to give back because it is the right thing to do,\u201d said Mr. Unanue in the release.Goya is the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States, and millions of Latinos have grown up with Goya beans and spice blends, tasting their childhoods in the adobo and saz\u00f3n.But even so, the multibillion-dollar company, headquartered in New Jersey, can seem as corporate and faceless as any multinational food outfit.\u201cIt\u2019s really not a for-us by-us product,\u201d said Yadira Garcia, 36, a founder and the executive chef of Happy Healthy Latina, which uses culturally relevant cooking and gardening to help underserved communities eat healthier. \u201cIt\u2019s just marketed to us like it is.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just tell a part of our story and exalt a part of our story, and also profit off our pain and our joys, but not really truly be inclusive in our community,\u201d Ms. Garcia continued, before criticizing the company\u2019s leadership for a lack of diversity. \u201cYou can take our money, but we don\u2019t have a seat at their table.\u201dMr. Unanue visited the White House on Thursday to celebrate the president\u2019s signing of an executive order intending to improve Hispanic Americans\u2019 access to educational and economic opportunities. And on Friday, Mr. Unanue stood by his words during an appearance on the television program \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for saying \u2014 and especially when you\u2019re called by the president of the United States \u2014 you\u2019re going to say, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m busy. No thank you\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that to the Obamas, and I didn\u2019t say that to President Trump.\u201dOn Friday evening, President Trump tweeted his support of Goya, after a day of #BuyGoya tweets from his supporters fighting back against the boycott.The prominent chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s said that Mr. Unanue could have met with the president and taken a more moderate tone, instead of sparking the all-out social media war that has raged since Thursday afternoon.\u201cYou can go and say: \u2018Thank you for supporting the Latino community,\u2019\u201d Mr. Andres said in an interview. \u201cBut then to go and say you are a great leader? A great leader for whom?\u201dMr. Andr\u00e9s said he respects the Unanue family, and has worked with them in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, but called the praise of President Trump \u201cover the top.\u201d\u201cReally? Four months before elections? When he wants to send 1 million DACA children back to their countries?\u201d said Mr. Andr\u00e9s, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \u201cWhen he is caging children? When he is allowing militias to patrol the border?\u201dLatinos are projected to make up the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc in the 2020 election. In the 2018 midterm elections, Latinos voted Democratic by a more than two-to-one ratio, according to the Pew Research Center.To Gustavo Arellano, the author of \u201cTaco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America\u201d and a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Unanue\u2019s comments were consistent with those of a business owner looking for tax breaks, rather than a leader supporting his community.\u201cIt\u2019s a betrayal for these consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see Trump as the antithesis of Latinos, in fact, as the enemy.\u201dMr. Unanue\u2019s statement comes during the middle of a pandemic that has disproportionately affected Latino communities, while benefiting companies like Goya, whose pantry products, like canned beans, flew off grocery shelves. For Mr. Arellano, 41, the fact that Goya is a food brand makes it even more painful for Latino cooks.\u201cTo see something that represents nurture and community and family and most importantly the kitchen?\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where it\u2019s a stab in the heart. Or the stomach.\u201dAd\u00e1n Medrano, 71, is a chef and the author of \u201cDon\u2019t Count the Tortillas: The Art of Texas Mexican Cooking,\u201d a cookbook about the Mexican food of Texas. He said Goya\u2019s food donations are not enough.\u201cGoya has shown that by thinking and saying that Trump is a great man, it has become disconnected from the heartbeat of the Latinx community, and particularly with our food, which has been so important to our resistance,\u201d he said.In standardizing a product line, Goya has overlooked the nuances of different Hispanic cultures, said Eric Rivera, 38, the chef and owner of Addo in Seattle, a restaurant and food company that sells Latin American food and ingredients that it ships nationwide.\u201cWhat people do is put a blanket statement over what Latin American cooking is, and they call it Caribbean food and they expect it all to be the same,\u201d said Mr. Rivera, who is of Puerto Rican descent. \u201cMy problem, always, with Goya was that they basically homogenized all the flavors.\u201dMr. Rivera and other chefs have lines of spice blends, alternatives to the Goya brand. Ms. Garcia, of Happy Healthy Latina, is developing new products with Loisa, a New York-based Latin American food company in which she is a partner.\u201cThey just colonized our culture to benefit themselves,\u201d Mr. Rivera said, referencing the Unanue family heritage. \u201cThey literally just like, Christopher Columbus-ed us.\u201dAlain Delaqueriere contributed research.Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Go frozen without extra kitchen tools by combining sweet vermouth, fresh orange juice, orange liqueur and simple syrup, and freezing into a granita that\u2019s low alcohol by volume.

(The prepared slush also sits nicely in your freezer for a few days, covered, should your socially distanced gathering be limited to one guest.)However and whenever you approach your frozen drinks, you should follow a few tricks to making them simple and delicious.First, the colder everything starts out, the better. Tiffanie Barriere, a bartender and educator based in Atlanta known as the Drinking Coach, recommends chilling bottles or base mixes for a few hours in the refrigerator before blending.\u201cThat way, the ingredients are all the same temperature, and the final blended drink doesn\u2019t get too diluted,\u201d she said.ImageSweet vermouth slushes can be topped with the spirit of the drinker\u2019s choosing.Credit...David Malosh for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne.Ice is frozen water after all, so the more you use, the more you dilute your drink. Starting with cold bottles and mixes is key to keeping things frozen longer, whether you\u2019re blending with ice or pouring a spirit over a prepared slush, snow cone-style.Speaking of ice, use the right size. Medium-to-small cubes or crushed are best. Whenever possible, Ms. Barriere reaches for store-bought, bagged ice.\u201cIt\u2019s filtered and crushes easily,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to use those big ice cubes because that\u2019s just wasting a pretty cube.\u201dIf you don\u2019t have crushed ice or small cubes, you can make your own. Ms. Barriere wraps standard ice cubes in a clean table linen or dish towel and uses something heavy \u2014 a skillet and a firm hand work well \u2014 to crush them on a stable surface. Remember that ice absorbs flavors and aromas from the other items in your freezer, so keep frozen fish fillets and drink-bound ice far apart.Finally, the colder the drink, the less our taste buds perceive sweetness. Counter this by rimming your serving glasses with a bit of citrus juice and granulated sugar, adding a bit more simple syrup as you blend or topping your final cocktail with sweet, syrupy maraschino cherries (reach for the deep red, stemless versions whenever possible).No matter the month or locale, frozen drinks can be oversweet sugary messes, or they can be great, balanced cocktails. Choose for yourself!But Ms. Barriere makes the undeniable point: \u201cIt\u2019s a childhood memory. It was exciting to get Popsicles and ice cream for a treat as a kid. As an adult you can have that same frozen feeling \u2014 in a cocktail.\u201dRecipes: Sweet Vermouth Slush | Frozen Tom CollinsFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Not through self-medication, though I do not disparage the buzz. But simply through the fascinating combination of grape, place and person that can make every good bottle either a new adventure or an old, beloved story.I went in search of thrills and values late last month. Or rather, I did it pandemic style, letting my fingers do the shopping through the online inventories of New York wine shops. I tried them all at home and have come up with what I think is an excellent and unusual assortment of 20 wines under $20. They come from 11 different countries, in quite different proportion from my usual array.For one thing, five of the wines are American, four from California and one from Washington. I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s unprecedented, but California, for numerous reasons, is not usually fertile ground for good values. Perhaps bottles generally destined for restaurants ended up instead at retailers. Or maybe producers in California have finally taken up the challenge of making interesting, honest, moderately priced wines.With these wines, don\u2019t expect the most famous grapes from the most prized vineyard areas. Indeed, the two reds from California are blends, leading with carignan and petite sirah from various sites in the sweeping North Coast appellation. One of two whites is a blend of pinot gris and pinot blanc. The other is a chardonnay, though from the wilds of Mendocino.These 20 bottles include none from Spain, usually a wonderful source of great values. Why not? I don\u2019t know. Earlier this year Spanish bottles dominated a roundup of wines under $15, so don\u2019t hesitate to experiment with a few on your own.Now, I can\u2019t emphasize this enough: I am not asserting that these 20 bottles are the best values in the world under $20. They are all excellent deals, but they represent simply a cross-section of what I could find on the websites of Manhattan retail shops in June 2020.That, I am sorry to say, will differ from what\u2019s available in Atlanta or Dallas, or Milwaukee or Salt Lake City, to say nothing of all the countries within internet reach of this column. Some of these bottles you may find, others not.What to do if you can\u2019t find a specific bottle? I recommend these steps:Find a good wine shop. The most important step toward improving your drinking is to shop at a store that loves wine rather than treating it as a random consumer product. It will have assembled an inventory of scrupulously made wines from meticulously farmed grapes. These 20 bottles are not all big brands. You won\u2019t find them at supermarkets.If a good retailer does not have a bottle, ask the merchant to suggest an equivalent wine. Most shops will be happy to take on this challenge. If they don\u2019t have, say, a Croatian posip or a German weissburgunder, perhaps the two most esoteric bottles in this selection, they may find something equally obscure that they esteem. Why not try something new on a recommendation?Use an online tool, like wine-searcher.com, to track down bottles. You might find them in other stores. For American wines, dozens of states permit you to buy directly from wineries and have it shipped to your home.Consult previous 20 Under $20 columns. Most of these bottles are still excellent deals, though some prices may have crept up slightly.If all else fails \u2014 I don\u2019t expect anybody to find all these bottles in one place, I sure didn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s nice to know that these wines exist in the world, even if they are not immediately available. Seriously, in the days before theater and restaurants closed down, I enjoyed reading about a play that opened in London or a restaurant in Los Angeles without the immediate expectation of experiencing either. You may not find this bottle now, but it may show up in the future if you keep your eyes open. And it\u2019s great to know wines like these exist.Thinking seasonally, this list emphasizes whites, sparklers and ros\u00e9s, but it does include eight red wines, because, well, one always needs reds. Here are the 20 bottles, in no particular order.ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesZlatan Otok Hvar Posip 2018 $17.99This bottle from Croatia may seem obscure. But this sumptuous white, made from the indigenous grape posip, is rich, herbal, savory and deliciously refreshing. For now, wines like this, made from grapes little known to Americans in regions yet to achieve international popularity, are great values. Zlatan Otok, on the island of Hvar, was established in 1991. It\u2019s now one of the larger wineries in the country. (Vinum USA, Basking Ridge, N.J.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesLe Vigne di Alice Vittorio Veneto Tajad Frizzante NV $18.99This gently sparkling wine is a modern interpretation of the wines made in an era before the glera grape came to dominate Prosecco. It\u2019s a blend of indigenous varieties, including 40 percent boschera, 40 percent verdiso and 20 percent glera. However, it\u2019s not strictly old school. Cinzia Canzian, the winemaker, achieves the bubbles through the bulk-production Charmat method, also used for industrial Prosecco. But by comparison with mass-market bottles, this wine seems handmade, easygoing and perfectly refreshing. (PortoVino, Buffalo)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesTroupis Arcadia Moschofilero Hoof & Lur 2019 $19.99Moschofilero, like pinot gris and its Greek cousin, roditis, is a pink-skinned grape. If the juice sits briefly with the skins before vinification, it develops a pale salmon color, so let\u2019s call Hoof & Lur a ros\u00e9. This wine, made without added yeast or filtration in the Peloponnese region of Greece, is fragrant and floral, bone-dry and lightly fruity. (DNS Wines/T. Elenteny Imports, New York)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesBroc Cellars North Coast Love Red 2018 $19.99Broc Cellars is one of my favorites among the new wave of California producers. Chris Brockway, the proprietor, specializes in tracking down well-farmed grapes, no matter how obscure, from undervalued vineyards around the state. The wines in Broc\u2019s Love series are lower-priced and made to quench thirsts. With its lively fruit flavors, this red, a blend mostly of carignan, with some valdigu\u00e9 and syrah thrown in, is perfect for an outdoor barbecue. Chill it up, pour it out and prepare to be refreshed.ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesDirty & Rowdy North Coast Unfamiliar Red 2017 $19.99Dirty & Rowdy operates very much like Broc, prospecting California for grapes and vineyards off the beaten trail, though with a more puckish attitude. The 2017 Unfamiliar Red is more structured than the Broc Love Red. Its primary component is petite sirah, a notoriously tannic grape. The tannins are apparent here but very much in check. Zinfandel, carignan and mourv\u00e8dre round out the blend. It\u2019s fresh and fruity and would be just right with juicy burgers off the grill.ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesBrand Pfalz Weissburgunder Trocken 2018 1 liter $19Daniel and Jonas Brand, two brothers, work in the northern reaches of the Pfalz region of Germany, where they farm organically and make a wide selection of excellent wines, many of them, like this one, sold in 1-liter bottles. This is made of weissburgunder, also known as pinot blanc. It\u2019s a creamy, textured wine that feels so good in the mouth you just want to keep drinking it, rolling it around and seeking out nuances. (Vom Boden, Brooklyn, N.Y.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesNiepoort Douro Tinto Twisted 2018 $19Dirk Niepoort is one of Portugal\u2019s most interesting and influential producers. Based in Douro, port country, he pioneered the movement toward making lighter, fresher wines that aimed for finesse rather than power. Twisted is a perfect example. It\u2019s a field blend of port varieties, a wine that maybe 15 years ago would have been heavy and jammy. It\u2019s far more of a precise wine these days, lightly tannic and fresh, reminiscent of port but delightful now. It will improve for a few years, too. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesChiara Condello Romagna Sangiovese Predappio 2016 $19.99In Italy, sangiovese is not grown only in Tuscany. It\u2019s the country\u2019s most abundant red grape and has been cultivated in Emilia-Romagna for centuries. Chiara Condello, a young producer from a family of winemakers, makes this wine under her own label. It is 100 percent sangiovese, and it\u2019s more overtly fruity than, say, a Chianti Classico. But it carries similarly dusty tannins and is nuanced and energetic. (Bowler Wine, New York)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesMeinklang \u00d6sterreich Prosa Sparkling Ros\u00e9 2019 $17.96Meinklang, the biodynamic estate in the Burgenland region of Austria, almost never fails to delight. Whether blaufr\u00e4nkisch, gr\u00fcner veltliner or anything else, the wines are always pure, fresh and delicious. This lightly sparkling ros\u00e9 is made of pinot noir, tastes gently of red fruit and flowers, and will go with burgers, grilled salmon or even just by itself. (Zev Rovine Selections, Brooklyn, N.Y.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesMother Rock Swartland Force Celeste S\u00e9millon 2018 $17.99S\u00e9millon makes wonderful wines, but you don\u2019t see them often. It\u2019s a crucial component of Sauternes and the dry whites of Graves, even as many producers there reduce the proportion in favor of sauvignon blanc. Excellent, age-worthy versions come from the Hunter Valley of Australia, while California and Oregon make a few. This, from Mother Rock, is the first South African s\u00e9millon that I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s bone dry and full of the grape\u2019s characteristic aromas and flavors of beeswax, lemon and honey. Bravo. (Vine Street Imports, Mount Laurel, N.J.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesLeitz Rheingau Sylvaner Trocken Alte Reben 2016 $19.96Sylvaner, or silvaner as it\u2019s also spelled frequently, is a perpetually underrated grape. When conscientiously farmed and made with care, like this one, it\u2019s a perfect spring or summer white. This wine, tangy and light, yet with flavors that resonate, won\u2019t be easy to find. But I include it because it\u2019s excellent, and perhaps it will inspire you to try a sylvaner, whether this one of from another producer like Stefan Vetter, Ostertag, Dirler-Cad\u00e9 or maybe one you discover yourself. (Schatzi Wines, Milan, N.Y.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesGaspard Vin de France Sauvignon Blanc 2018 $16.96Jenny & Fran\u00e7ois is one of the pioneering American importers of natural wines. Gaspard is the name of its private label, and this wine is delicious. Made from sauvignon blanc grown in the Touraine region of the Loire Valley, this wine will not remind you of the more pungent sauvignon blanc associated with New Zealand. It\u2019s a more gentle, resonant style reminiscent of a restrained Sancerre. (Jenny & Fran\u00e7ois Selections, New York)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesFamilie Bauer Wagram Terassen Roter Veltliner 2018 $16.96What is roter veltliner, you ask, gr\u00fcner veltliner\u2019s whirling sibling? The grapes are actually unrelated, the ampelographers say, though it does have some similarities, like a pleasing peppery spiciness. But this Austrian wine, made from organic grapes, is richer and rounder, pure, clear and deep. It would make an interesting alternative to chardonnay. (Savio Soares Selections, New York)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesFabien Jouves Cahors Haute C\u00f4t(e) de Fruit Malbec 2018 $17.99Fabien Jouves is one of the best young producers in Cahors in southwest France. Those wines meant to reflect the characteristics of particular terroirs are bottled under the name of his estate, Mas del P\u00e9ri\u00e9. Those intended primarily for thirst-quenching, like this one, carry his own name. The red grape of the region, malbec, is also known as c\u00f4t, hence the pun on the label. Whichever name you choose for the grape, this is a less effusive expression of malbec than the familiar Argentine version, fruity yet tapered and lightly mineral. Chill a bit before serving.

This bottle, from a biodynamic vineyard in Mendocino County, is lean and lively with lovely citrus and herbal flavors, a blessed relief from heavy, oaky California chardonnays.ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesAu Bon Climat Santa Barbara County Pinot Gris/Pinot Blanc 2018 $19.99Jim Clendenen is the man, or as he prefers to put it, the mind, behind Au Bon Climat. I\u2019m not sure he is exactly unsung, but he is a hero for his advocacy both of the Santa Barbara region and for wines of restraint and subtlety. In the annals of American wine, where attention seems to gravitate to the newest thing, it\u2019s always worth remembering what good wines he\u2019s been making for years. This white blend, two-thirds pinot gris, one-third pinot blanc, is savory and sumptuous, not at all heavy but quite refreshing. It would be great with richer fish or chicken off the grill.ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesPunt Road Airlie Bank Yarra Valley Gris on Skins 2019 $19.99Clear glass bottles are almost always unfortunate, as they expose wines to possible damage from light. But they seem irresistible to ros\u00e9 producers as they show off the variety of pink colors possible in wine. This Australian one is a pale maraschino, and it is quite beautiful. More important, it\u2019s absolutely dry and refreshing, with the faintest rasp of pleasant tannin to scrub the mouth clean. Made of pinot gris fermented with its skins, which accounts for that lovely color. (Little Peacock, New York)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesSeresin Marlborough Momo Pinot Noir 2018 $18.99Inexpensive pinot noir is often a dicey proposition. Too often the money-saving compromises mean that this difficult-to-grow grape was planted in the wrong place, or that the production process cut multiple corners. But this wine, made from organic grapes grown in the Marlborough region of New Zealand, is true to the spirit of pinot noir, resulting in a fresh, graceful, refreshing wine redolent of flowers and red fruit. Drink lightly chilled. (The Sorting Table, Napa, Calif.)ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesRasa Vineyards Occam\u2019s Razor Columbia Valley Red Wine Blend 2017 $19.99This blend of cabernet sauvignon and syrah calls for steaks grilled over coals. It\u2019s got the substance and body \u2014 14.5 percent alcohol \u2014 to handle fatty, juicy beef, yet it wears its heft easily without feeling heavy or syrupy. As befitting the name Occam\u2019s Razor, which postulates that the simplest explanation is the most likely, this wine is not complicated, it\u2019s just satisfying.ImageCredit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesPierre & Rodolphe Gauthier Domaine du Bel Air Bourgueil Jour de Soif 2019 $17.99Domaine du Bel Air, run by a father-and-son team, makes fine, age-worthy wines from organic cabernet franc. Jour de Soif is their entry-level bottle, made from younger vines, which are nonetheless still 20 years old. Yet this is no mere vin de soif. You can sense the structure of the other cuv\u00e9es in the fine tannins that give shape to this otherwise fresh and juicy wine. Not shy at 14.3 percent alcohol, it, too, would be great for grilled meats. (Polaner Selections)Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Traditionally, the city\u2019s sidewalk cafes tended to be dull to look at, crowded rows of tables hemmed in by plain metal railings. The new ones are more expressive. Governed by two emergency programs meant to let restaurants earn some money until indoor dining can resume, these structures follow a set of rules for keeping the public safe from the coronavirus and, when the seating is placed in parking spaces, from passing cars. Within and around these rules, however, creativity blossomed.A few restaurateurs consulted with the Rockwell Group, Pink Sparrow and other design firms that have dreamed up modular, prefabricated platforms and barriers. Nearly everybody else winged it. Working quickly with small budgets and the awareness that anything they build now will probably have to be torn down in September or October, when the programs end, restaurateurs have built little public gardens to welcome New Yorkers back from their long sequestrations.These oases, surrounded by plants and shaded by wide umbrellas, have temporarily transformed the city. Owners in some neighborhoods, like Chinatown in Manhattan and the Mexican strip in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, have been unable to take advantage of the programs so far. But in many others, every block or so holds out the possibility of a quick getaway to a faraway beach or an elegant urban glade. The promise of these outdoor cafes is a few hours of relief from our well-founded fears.Ruby\u2019s Caf\u00e9, NoLItaImageLike most of the United States-Canadian border, the line between Little Italy and NoLIta is not clearly marked. But you know you\u2019re in NoLIta the minute you see the planter boxes surrounding the Mulberry Street seating area for Ruby\u2019s Caf\u00e9. They\u2019re painted millennial pink. The color scheme is just one of the ways Ruby\u2019s has the maximized the limited design possibilities of a temporary structure that sits on a gray platform built over a patch of New York City asphalt. The chairs are mod bent-plywood numbers, strings of lights suggest a garden and the sun is kept out by a flax-colored awning. A speaker pointed at the sidewalk floats a chill, party soundtrack over the tables, but clear plastic partitions between the tables help keep the scene from evolving into a socially undistanced dance party.Baby Brasa, Greenwich VillageImageUntil recently, it might have been possible to walk past the corner of Seventh Avenue and Perry Street without noticing Baby Brasa. This is no longer the case. The restaurant took over a long stretch of the avenue on the far side of the bike lane, furnishing it with chairs, umbrellas, palm trees and two inflatable pink flamingoes the size of Jacuzzis. Eduardo Trejo, a manager, said he had ordered the birds from Amazon to give the street dining zone a little \u201cMiami style.\u201d They also complement the restaurant\u2019s extremely popular Pink Flamingo cocktail, \u201ca ros\u00e9-y slushie\u201d that takeout customers can buy in a clear plastic pouch that looks like an I.V. bag. One of the flamingoes is meant to be a pool float. The other was designed as a splash pool. Baby Brasa has not filled it with water, but that has not kept customers from sitting inside the flamingo, cocktails in hand. By the end of last weekend, a customer had accidentally punctured its head. The rest of the animal remained inflated, though. \u201cIt\u2019s another V.I.P. table,\u201d Mr. Trejo said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/dining/krewe-restaurant-mateo-mackbee-erin-lucas.html", "title": "Two Chefs Moved to Rural Minnesota to Expand on Their Mission of Racial Justice", "summary": "Mateo Mackbee and Erin Lucas left Minneapolis for a small central Minnesota community, where they are using their restaurant, bakery and farm to promote diversity and teach children about food.", "authors": "By Brett Anderson", "text": "ST. JOSEPH, Minn. \u2014 Krewe, a restaurant in this small central-Minnesota city, is a tribute to Mary Mackbee, a former high school principal who raised four children in a Twin Cities suburb on the cooking of her native New Orleans.\u201cMore than anything, gumbo is the smell I remember,\u201d said Mateo Mackbee, one of those children and the chef and co-owner of Krewe. \u201cThat\u2019s one you would get outside the front door.\u201dMr. Mackbee was in the dining room of Krewe, a window-lined restaurant in a new low-rise building in downtown St. Joseph, a community of 7,000 about 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis. His mother was there, too, sharing stories about her life and overseeing the jambalaya that Mr. Mackbee\u2019s 21-year-old son, Makel, was cooking for takeout service later that day.Krewe\u2019s sign reads \u201cest. 1944,\u201d Ms. Mackbee\u2019s birth year, even though it opened in late May, four days after George Floyd was killed while in the custody of the Minneapolis police.Mr. Mackbee, 47, and Erin Lucas, 27, his girlfriend and business partner, moved to central Minnesota from Minneapolis two years ago. They were driven by a shared desire to bring awareness of racial inequities to rural communities, and to find an alternative to the limited career options available to them in Minneapolis and St. Paul.ImageMr. Mackbee at Krewe, his New Orleans-style restaurant in St. Joseph.\u00a0Credit...Andrea Ellen Reed for The New York Times\u201cI had grown kind of weary of the restaurant scene in the Twin Cities, where it was hard for someone like myself,\u201d Mr. Mackbee said. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit older and a little bit darker than most of the people on the line.\u201dThe partners began with a successful pop-up restaurant in New London, a small city in a neighboring county. They sank deeper roots this spring, when they also opened Flour & Flower, a bakery in a cottage-style building behind Krewe. Ms. Lucas is the bakery\u2019s chef.On a sunny morning in mid-June, the line of customers waiting to buy her croissants, baguettes and pastries ran outside the bakery nearly to Krewe\u2019s back door. Both businesses are a short bicycle ride from the Lake Wobegon Trail.ImageMs. Lucas is the chef at Flour & Flower, a bakery located in the alley behind Krewe.\u00a0Credit...Andrea Ellen Reed for The New York TimesSt. Joseph, though home to the small liberal-arts College of Saint Benedict, is not a cradle of racial diversity. It\u2019s more than 90 percent white. Locals whose families have lived here for generations say Krewe is the city\u2019s first brick-and-mortar business owned by an African-American. And the community is in a part of Minnesota known for its divisive politics around immigration and race.But St. Joseph offered Mr. Mackbee an opportunity for ownership that he hadn\u2019t received in the cities, despite his culinary degree and nearly a decade of experience in some of the area\u2019s most respected restaurants. He proudly points out that three members of Krewe\u2019s four-person kitchen staff are people of color.\u201cWe\u2019ve flipped the scenario that I\u2019m normally used to,\u201d he said.Jon C. Petters, who owns the properties where Krewe and Flour & Flower are located, sold the couple hard on the potential of opening their businesses in St. Joseph. Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas were first wooed to central Minnesota by Mark Kopka, whom Mr. Mackbee met in 2015 in a bar in a Twin Cities suburb. Mr. Kopka is the pastor of Nordland Lutheran Church in Paynesville, which, like St. Joseph, is in Stearns County.ImageMark Kopka is the pastor of Nordland Lutheran Church in Paynesville.

But the chefs were welcomed for reasons that went beyond their culinary talent.\u201cA lot of people who grew up here, they\u2019ve never known a person of color,\u201d said Steve Peterson, 62, a retired General Mills executive from Paynesville who attends Mr. Kopka\u2019s church. \u201cThere\u2019s something about these guys being here that helps.\u201dStearns County, while still about 85 percent white, is home to some of the largest immigrant communities in Minnesota. Agriculture and food-processing jobs in central Minnesota towns like Willmar (home to Jennie-O Turkey, in neighboring Kandiyohi County), and St. Cloud, the Stearns County seat, have drawn workers, particularly from East Africa and Latin America, for three decades.The demographic changes have touched off a rise in nativist politics and xenophobia in Stearns and bordering counties. In 2017, a St. Cloud City Council member proposed a moratorium on new immigrants. The motion failed, but it attested to the open white resentment over immigration. The same year, a Willmar man was arrested after placing a pig\u2019s foot on the table of a farmers\u2019 market booth operated by young Somali Muslims.ImageMr. Mackbee in the kitchen at Krewe. The chef ate New Orleans food growing up in the suburbs outside the Twin Cities.\u00a0Credit...Andrea Ellen Reed for The New York TimesGrowing up in Stearns County, Emma Ditlevson, a 21-year-old Krewe line cook, overheard friends\u2019 parents as they criticized immigrants for failing to assimilate.\u201cI don\u2019t think people here realize that it\u2019s a beautiful thing to represent a different culture in a community that doesn\u2019t have that much diversity,\u201d said Ms. Ditlevson, who was born in South Korea and adopted by a white couple. \u201cInstead of seeing the culture as something beautiful and something to embrace and something to understand more, they see it as something people should just give up.\u201dMr. Mackbee said St. Joseph doesn\u2019t feel far removed from the unrest and anger unleashed by Mr. Floyd\u2019s killing. The St. Cloud police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters three weeks after Mr. Floyd\u2019s death.He and Ms. Lucas were drawn to the region in part for the opportunity to confront issues of racial injustice with Model Citizen, just on prairie land instead of pavement \u2014 an impulse that is as much a tribute to his mother\u2019s influence as Krewe\u2019s menu.\u201cWe\u2019re probably worse here, as far as racial tension,\u201d Mr. Mackbee said. \u201cI feel like my mom prepared me for coming out here and facing whatever comes my way.\u201dMr. Mackbee is soft-spoken, though blunt. Two years ago, he ran for City Council in New London. \u201cI came in third,\u201d he said.Small-town life is not new to him. He attended college in rural Wisconsin on a soccer scholarship. While there, he recalled, he was asked to speak to a white student who had hung a noose over a Black student\u2019s dorm-room door.\u201cThey wanted me to be the one to tell this guy this was a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a token my entire life.\u201dKrewe\u2019s opening would be notable even if it were in New Orleans, a majority-Black city where restaurants owned by African-Americans are still relatively rare. Equally unusual are restaurant chefs of Mr. Mackbee\u2019s training who learned to cook New Orleans cuisine at home \u2014 through recipes that descend directly from African-American home cooks of the Jim Crow era.Mr. Mackbee has never worked in a New Orleans-style restaurant. And the food Ms. Mackbee cooked for her children in the 1980s and \u201990s was virtually untouched by the vagaries of contemporary restaurant trends. The first time she ate at a white-owned restaurant, she said, was on a visit to Commander\u2019s Palace, in New Orleans, in the mid-60s. She moved to the Twin Cities a few years later.\u201cI never had a steak until I came up here,\u201d she said. \u201cI always thought steak was cooked with gravy.\u201dMr. Mackbee talks about his mother\u2019s 51-year career as an educator as much as he does about her cooking. Ms. Mackbee served 26 years as principal of Central High School, the state\u2019s oldest high school and the largest in its capital, St. Paul.ImageMary Mackbee, Mr. Mackbee\u2019s mother, at Central High School in St. Paul, where she served as principal for 26 years.Credit...Jerry Holt/Star Tribune, via Getty ImagesShe retired in 2019, two years after one of her former students, Melvin Carter III, was elected St. Paul\u2019s first African-American mayor. Ms. Mackbee spoke at his inauguration, which was held at Central High.\u201cShe was one of those principals who never sat in her office,\u201d Mr. Mackbee said. \u201cShe\u2019s broken her wrist and all that kind of stuff, breaking up fights at school.\u201dMs. Mackbee, 76, leaned into adversity while growing up in segregated New Orleans. Her civil-rights activism occasionally drew her away from Louisiana as a young adult.She recalled knocking on the door of a Roman Catholic bishop in Mobile, Ala., in 1965. She was there to voice her displeasure with the bishop\u2019s removal of a priest who had provided shelter for her and other Black activists when they traveled to Selma to protest that summer.Ms. Mackbee ended up taking her grievance to a higher authority. \u201cWe wrote a letter to the pope,\u201d she said. \u201cNever heard from him.\u201dImageMs. Mackbee inside Krewe, which is a tribute to her.\u00a0Credit...Andrea Ellen Reed for The New York TimesShe married Earsell Mackbee, a cornerback for the Minnesota Vikings, after moving to St. Paul in the late \u201960s to become the only Black teacher at a nearly all-white public school. After the couple divorced, Ms. Mackbee raised their four children alone in suburban Bloomington.She cooked her family large pots of the dishes she had grown up eating in New Orleans, except that she used sausage where her mother, struggling to make ends meet, used hot dogs.\u201cThat was the economical way,\u201d Ms. Mackbee said. \u201cBut I had a job, so I could afford some real sausage.\u201dMr. Mackbee cooked dinner for a group of friends at Krewe in mid-June, when the restaurant was open only for takeout.

(\u201cOur Willmar water is some of the best water for raising shrimp,\u201d Mr. Damhof said.)Similar ingredients enriched a spicy jambalaya Mr. Mackbee also learned from his mother. Instead of mixing the ingredients together as in a paella, the traditional method in southern Louisiana, the Mackbees\u2019 jambalaya is a savory sauce spooned over plain rice. \u201cThe way I make it, you don\u2019t have to fish out the shrimp,\u201d Ms. Mackbee said of the idiosyncratic technique.ImageJambalaya at Krewe.\u00a0Credit...Andrea Ellen Reed for The New York TimesMatt Lindstrom, a friend of the chefs, sampled these dishes, along with red beans, barbecue shrimp and bread pudding, as New Orleans music played in Krewe\u2019s dining room. Mr. Lindstrom, 50, is a political-science professor at Saint John\u2019s University, a small liberal-arts college for men just outside St. Joseph that is closely affiliated with the all-woman College of Saint Benedict.He struggled to explain his excitement over finding a place like Krewe in St. Joseph.\u201cWhen I was a kid, it was a big deal to go to Applebee\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Lindstrom, who grew up in Willmar. \u201cAnd you had to drive to St. Cloud for that.\u201dIn September, Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas hope to bring the first group of local students to the one-acre farm they are building with Mr. Kopka and other collaborators in Paynesville. It\u2019s based on a project the chefs tried out in New London.\u201cOne of the things we noticed is that all of these kids are literally surrounded by farmland,\u201d Mr. Mackbee said, \u201cbut they literally don\u2019t have the opportunity to step onto it.\u201dMs. Lucas remembers how thrilled some young Somali students were by the sight of rhubarb, assuming it was tamarind. \u201cThey were like, \u2018We haven\u2019t seen this since we were home,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lucas said.ImageThe farm is on the land in Paynesville, not far from Mr. Kopka\u2019s church.Credit...Andrea Ellen Reed for The New York TimesThe new farm is near the north fork of the Crow River, on land donated to Model Citizen by the retired executive Mr. Peterson and his wife, Mary, through a partnership with Nordland church. Mr. Peterson spent his later years at General Mills trying to educate farmers on the virtues of regenerative agriculture, a sustainable farming practice that aims to improve the soil.\u201cWe see this farm as a model for the area,\u201d said Mr. Peterson, \u201cto encourage other young people to be entrepreneurs, and to do what\u2019s right for the land.\u201dBy year\u2019s end, Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas plan to have a chicken coop, sheep and a wood-fired oven to cook for outdoor parties on the property. The ingredients will show up on their menus. And, ideally, the farm will enrich the community in other ways.Standing outdoors on a windy afternoon last month, Mr. Mackbee looked toward a patch of forest at the edge of the still-unplowed farmland. \u201cI need to get the kids out here to see it and to smell it,\u201d he said.His thoughts drifted toward a future when he can host children of color from the Twin Cities, like those his mother taught for so many years.\u201cIf we can just get them out here for a while, away from the stress,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe we can help give them what they need, to be what they want to be, and not what society says they are.\u201dFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

Lauded chefs like Tim McKee, Alex Roberts, Doug Flicker and Gavin Kaysen have kept the region on the lips and must-visit lists of gastro-tourists. Minneapolis has large Southeast Asian and East African neighborhoods with mom-and-pop restaurants that rival any of their kind in the nation.But Minnesota has a marked scarcity of food businesses owned or operated by African-Americans. Of the more than half-million businesses that the 2012 census reported in the state, about 20,000 were Black-owned.There are so few African-American food and beverage establishments in the Twin Cities that they are nearly impossible to find if you don\u2019t know where to look \u2014 even on the Northside of Minneapolis, where more than half the residents are Black (in a city where less than 20 percent of the population is African-American).Since the killing of George Floyd and amid continued protests against racial injustice, some restaurant owners, chefs and others have begun talking about ways to change that imbalance.\u201cI am a Black restaurateur and I am changing it by existing,\u201d said Jared Brewington, 41, who has opened two restaurants. One of them, Funky Grits, at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, was directly across the street from the site of Mr. Floyd\u2019s fatal encounter with the police, before closing last October.The other, Thigh Times Birdhouse, in the city\u2019s gentrified North Loop neighborhood, closed during the pandemic. Mr. Brewington hopes to reopen in another location, and he has shifted his focus to plans for a new bar and restaurant, Cologne House Cafe, in rural Cologne, Minn., about 36 miles from Minneapolis., where he lives with his wife, Jenn, and their young daughter.He and his business partner, Ben Brickweg, are working on a crowdsourcing platform to help L.G.B.T. people and people of color find capital to start businesses. He hopes it will inspire white people to invest in those projects. \u201cCall it a guilt bucket, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Brewington said.Dawn Drouillard, 49, and Eden Fitzgerald, 46, are the white co-owners of Fabulous Catering, known for their work for high-end clients and galas. The pandemic has so stymied their business that they plan to shut down.But rather than quickly sell their building to the \u201cwhite development people\u201d who they say are already showing interest, Ms. Drouillard said they hope to find a way for people of color to acquire it.\u201cThere are so many glaring inequities in our city,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a small, little piece of the pie to give. The only asset we have is our building.\u201dImageDawn Drouillard and Eden Fitzgerald, co-owners of Fabulous Catering, which is closing due to the pandemic, are hoping to find a way for people of color to acquire their building.Credit...Jenn Ackerman for The New York TimesTo that end, the partners have turned their facilities \u2014 just over a mile from the Third Precinct police station that went up in flames in the days after Mr. Floyd\u2019s death \u2014 over to a food-relief operation called F12 People\u2019s Kitchen, in which volunteers serve about 1,200 meals a week to homeless people living in a neighborhood encampment. The group is trying to secure funding \u2014 through grass-roots efforts on social media, as well as via Nexus Community Partners, an organization that helps community wealth building \u2014 and hopes ultimately to buy the Fabulous Catering building.The collective envisions running it as a community kitchen that small food businesses can use, and where community members can simply get a hot meal if they need one. Gina Pe\u00f1a, 26, who identifies as \u201ca young, queer, Black person who loves to cook,\u201d is currently working as the group\u2019s lead cook.Eddie Wu, 41, who with his wife, Eve Wu, 40, owns the celebrated breakfast-and-lunch diner Cook St. Paul, said they are talking about not reopening whenever the governor gives the green light, and instead turning the diner over to people of color to run.\u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d said Mr. Wu, a white man who took his Korean wife\u2019s surname. \u201cI can use what privilege I have. Enough with white people.\u201dImageEve and Eddie Wu are planning to offer six-month residencies to chefs of color at their restaurant, Cook St. Paul.Credit...Jenn Ackerman for The New York TimesMr. Wu has never been content to quietly run a restaurant. When Philando Castile was fatally shot by a police officer in St. Paul in 2016, Mr. Wu placed signs reading \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cPhilando Castile Matters\u201d on his marquee, drawing a backlash from some white customers.Before Mr. Wu bought the diner in 2013, it housed Serlin\u2019s Cafe, a 67-year old, white-owned restaurant slinging pancakes and hash browns. Under Mr. Wu\u2019s ownership, the diner changed much the same way as its East Side neighborhood, which has attracted a large Southeast Asian population, serving dishes like bibimbap alongside the basted eggs.Mr. Wu also offered the space to rising chefs and restaurateurs for pop-ups before pop-ups became commonplace in Minnesota, charging them little more than the night\u2019s operating expenses. Now, the Wus want to extend that model, offering chefs of color, especially Black chefs, residencies of six months or longer, and perhaps living quarters upstairs.Mr. Wu said he wants to see exceptional chefs of color get some of the recognition that now goes to \u201cthe boring white dudes that we\u2019ve got a never-ending supply of here in Minnesota \u2014 which includes me.\u201dAllena Dancer, a 44-year-old Black woman who ran two one-night pop-ups at Cook St. Paul, is in talks with the Wus about taking on the first residency this summer. She said her project, called the Peach Eatery, would serve \u201csoul comfort food,\u201d like her peach cobbler and her husband\u2019s Memphis-inspired smoked meat.\u201cFor me, this means getting my name out there without worrying about all the overhead,\u201d Ms. Dancer said. \u201cPeople know Cook. This will give me a name to show people that there is good soul food, and it\u2019s consistent, and it\u2019s here to stay. My daughter is 3, and she already wants a kitchen.

We just have to be able to get it into the hands of the people who need it.\u201dMs. Baker, 27, tracks down growers willing to donate surplus food, manages a lengthening list of volunteers itching to do something safely outdoors, and drives contributions to a wholesale produce market where her organization rents a corner of a warehouse refrigerator.ImageAs part of her job as a gleaning coordinator, Virginia Baker drives straight from the farm to a warehouse where the produce is redistributed.Credit...John Taggart for The New York TimesEach of those steps has been slowed by the need to don protective gear, sanitize and maintain social distancing.

Over the past four months, Du Nord has been buffeted and transformed by each new trauma to shake the city, and the world.In mid-March, with the coronavirus converging on the United States, the couple, like many other distillers, ceased making their gin, vodka, whiskey and liqueurs, and began manufacturing much-needed hand sanitizer.Mr. Montana handed out that sanitizer to protesters outside the nearby Third Precinct police station after the killing of George Floyd on May 25. The distiller was tear-gassed twice for his trouble.In the early hours of May 29, Du Nord, like many businesses in the neighborhood, was in flames. The fire activated its sprinkler system, which added water damage to the devastation.

I might be bummed because some people set fire to my distillery. That saddens me and angered me. But right now, I have food every night. I\u2019m fine. There are people doing so much worse than I am.\u201dDu Nord\u2019s experience is all the more remarkable in the current cultural context because Mr. Montana is one of the few Black distillery owners in the United States.ImageA door at Du Nord was broken into during the unrest following George Floyd\u2019s killing.Credit...Jenn Ackerman for The New York TimesDuring the protests and ensuing unrest that engulfed much of East Lake Street, he had to weigh his instincts as a business owner against the dangers that might await him outside.

Are they going to think he\u2019s a distillery owner mourning his distillery?\u201dImageEmployees salvaged some whiskey from the fire.Credit...Jenn Ackerman for The New York TimesThough the Montanas, who have three young children, have enough to contend with on their own, their focus has been helping the community. The food bank in the distillery has paused while critical repairs are made to the waterlogged building, but Du Nord is likely to reopen it, based on community need in the coming months.When friends started GoFundMe accounts for them, the couple\u2019s reaction was to answer those efforts with a fund-raising drive of their own to help other businesses in the area owned by people of color. \u201cI knew a lot of them were uninsured or underinsured,\u201d Mr. Montana said.The Du Nord Craft Spirits Riot Recovery Fund, administered by the newly created nonprofit Du Nord Foundation, has since raised roughly two-thirds of its $1 million goal. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that within the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to start writing checks,\u201d said Mr. Montana, who hopes to get back to producing spirits by the fall.This generosity in the face of personal adversity has not surprised the couple\u2019s friends and colleagues. \u201cHe\u2019s always making the best of whatever situation is handed to him,\u201d said Jon Kreidler, a co-founder of Tattersall Distilling, a Minneapolis company that teamed up with Du Nord on sanitizer production.ImageJon Kreidler, a founder of Tattersall Distillery, which joined with Du Nord to make hand sanitizer.Credit...Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times\u201cChris and Shanelle would never turn down an opportunity to serve the community,\u201d said Jessica Ward-Denison, an organizer of the food bank. \u201cWith the scariness and sadness of the days leading up to this, I think there was a great need for something positive.\u201dMs. Montana, who is white, took more time getting to that positive place.\u201dI was very angry for a long time,\u201d she said of the destruction. \u201cA lot that were hit were small mom-and-pop businesses by people of color that had been in business for a long time.\u201cBut as I talked to people, a lot of them said, \u2018If this is what it takes to change things, then this is what it takes.\u2019 It really changed my perspective. I got there. It took me longer, but I got there, to see the hope in this and to separate the damage from the change it might bring.\u201dMr. Montana benefited from a broader view, informed by his childhood. Soon after his family moved to Minnesota from Indiana, in 1991, he recalled a rally and chants of \u201cNo justice, no peace.\u201d\u201cThen, it was about Rodney King,\u201d he said. \u201cIt occurred to me that here we are, almost 30 years on, the chants are the same, the problems are the same.\u201dThis time, though, he senses a shift.\u201cI don\u2019t condone the property damage, but I do understand it,\u201d Mr. Montana said. \u201cIf that means there\u2019s going to be attention paid to this fundamental issue in our country, then it\u2019s worth it.

At Kith and Kin, which opened in 2017, he changed gears. He imbued the menu with historical associations of slavery and the African diaspora, leaning more heavily on home-cooking traditions from West Africa, the Caribbean and New Orleans.

She will hold the jobs simultaneously.Ms. Velez, who was nominated for the James Beard Foundation\u2019s Rising Star Pastry Chef award this year, said that the pandemic and the ongoing protests about the killings of Black people in police custody had reordered some of her priorities.\u201cIn our industry we are always typically fighting to keep the doors open,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce the doors were blown off the hinges, I had time on my hands and was able to think things through.\u201dOne of the things she thought through was her desire to \u201cdo things for the betterment of other people.\u201d In June she and two other pastry chefs founded Bakers Against Racism, an \u201conline virtual bake sale\u201d to benefit organizations that try to help Black people and communities.

You can still find a fair number of the bad old wines around, but the good ones can be a revelation.Until recently, I was mostly aware of Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi, a large appellation in the coastal region of the Marche. But I\u2019ve recently found wines from a smaller appellation, Verdicchio di Matelica, in the inland hills of the Marche, that I\u2019ve really enjoyed.So this month we\u2019re going to taste Verdicchio di Matelica.

If you cannot find these bottles, you can look for producers from either of the two verdicchio appellations, including La Staffa, Villa Bucci, Pievalta, Garofoli, Fontezoppa, Fattoria San Lorenzo, Velenosi and Umani Ronchi.These wines will all go great with Italian seafood pastas or pestos, light seafood dishes and poultry in citrus sauces, as well as many summery salad and vegetable preparations.A word of reminder: The point of Wine School is for you to drink these wines and form your own opinions.

This week, Caleb Kenna shares a collection of drone photographs from Vermont.Ever since I was young, I\u2019ve loved gazing out the oval windows of airplanes and daydreaming about the abstract geometric patterns below.Planes transport us from place to place, from country to country, from ground level to a bird\u2019s-eye view. From the air, familiar landscapes take on conceptual qualities; we gain fresh perspectives by viewing hidden patterns.Morning light casts a shadow of a maple tree at the University of Vermont\u2019s Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge.Fall foliage along Huff Pond Road in Sudbury.Otter Creek, in Brandon, flows north from Green Mountain National Forest to Lake Champlain.I have worked as a freelance photographer for more than twenty years, traveling Vermont\u2019s back roads, making portraits and capturing the state\u2019s iconic landscapes.Perspective \u2014 alongside light, color and timing \u2014 is a fundamental building block of photography, and I\u2019m always looking for new ways to alter mine. Until a few years ago, I hired airplanes \u2014 and hoped for good weather and a helpful pilot \u2014\u00a0to climb skyward and create aerial pictures. Nowadays I use a drone.ImageA farm road and fields of corn and hay in Clarendon.There are trade-offs, of course. Looking down at the ground virtually \u2014 through a remote-controlled lens \u2014 isn\u2019t a substitute, experientially, for actually taking to the skies. But it makes me less reliant on others and is much more environmentally friendly. (It\u2019s also a lot more convenient; I can set up and launch my drone, a DJI Mavic 2 Pro, in about five minutes.)Long shadows at a wetland in Brandon.A soccer field at Middlebury College.In Shoreham, three crab apple trees provide a break in the springtime pattern of an apple orchard in bloom.Using a drone is a natural evolution for a still photographer. On dull and cloudy days, I can rise above the world and create elevated photographs full of vibrant colors. On days with great light, I can capture the long shadows cast in farm fields by lone trees.ImageAbstract tractor patterns in light snow in Weybridge.I often look to Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s \u201cEquivalents\u201d photographs as a source of inspiration. The series of abstract cloud studies shot in the 1920s and 30s transcends representations of the physical world and offers a world of abstraction and metaphor. I\u2019m also influenced by the subsequent work of Minor White, a photographer who adopted and expanded on some of Stieglitz\u2019s principles.A kayaker on Lake Hortonia, in Sudbury.Fresh snowfall on an apple orchard in Cornwall.A pair of trees in a field in Weybridge.Most of my drone photographs were made around my home in Vermont\u2019s Champlain Valley. (The area is known as the land of milk and honey because of its many farms and apiaries.) But sometimes I venture farther afield.ImageA woman exercises on the track at Middlebury College.There is a soaring sense of excitement and discovery when ascending over familiar landscapes. And while the terrain where I fly is often well-known to me, I can rarely predict what kinds of compositions I\u2019ll walk away with.A maple tree in Orwell.Tractor tracks on a field in Weybridge.The Nulhegan River in the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge in Brunswick.Nor do I always know what my subjects will be. Once, while driving through the Mettawee Valley, a bucolic setting dotted with small towns and dairy farms, I pulled off the road next to a corn field and launched my drone \u2014\u00a0only to spot a beautiful old barn with a slate roof, completely hidden from my view on the ground.ImageAn old barn \u2014 hidden from view on the ground by the surrounding cornfields \u2014 in Rupert.Finding ongoing sources of creative inspiration is a challenge for any artist, and aerial photography has helped broaden the scope of my work. More than anything, though, making drone photographs has become a daily practice for me \u2014 one that often feels like a form of visual meditation.Caleb Kenna is a photographer and F.A.A.-certified drone pilot based in Middlebury, Vt.

And the price point isn\u2019t the only draw. What makes a hostel worth the gym mats moonlighting as mattresses or the bunk mate who snores so very, very loudly is the people you encounter.

I\u2019ve been messaging back and forth with Best Western on Facebook; the customer-service people said the hitch lies with the hotel owner, who is refusing to issue the refund. What\u2019s the point of flexible corporate cancellation policies if individual hotels aren\u2019t required to adhere to them? GeorgeHi George,The pandemic has brought to light some nerdy issues about the travel industry \u2014 ones that most of us never needed to think about before. But here we are, wondering aloud about the oversight capabilities of hotel franchises, and what powers they can exert over their thousands of individual owners.I got several emails about this topic. Nick, another reader, faced a nearly identical uphill battle while trying to cancel a June reservation at the Hilton Rome Airport. Hilton\u2019s stated policies for refunds are flexible, yet the individual hotel owner refuses to budge.For starters, the answer is yes: Whenever a company like Best Western or Hilton announces a flexible corporate cancellation policy, it\u2019s meant to apply to all branded hotels. But Best Western also states outright that a small percentage of individual owners may be eligible to deny refunds on a small percentage of bookings. And that\u2019s what happened here.A spokeswoman for Best Western said in a statement that \u201cDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Best Western Hotels & Resorts has offered a flexible cancellation policy to its valued guests. This policy includes that \u2018a more restrictive cancellation policy may apply to a limited number of high-demand dates at individual hotels,\u2019 which was applicable to this guest\u2019s reservation.\u201dAfter reaching out to Hilton, I learned that Nick got trapped by an even more peculiar loophole \u2014 a bizarre wrench in the pandemic\u2019s ever-expanding toolbox of bizarre wrenches. On March 17, Italy passed the \u201cCura Italia\u201d decree, a relief measure meant to offset the economic toll of the pandemic in one of the hardest-hit countries. The new law gave hotel owners in Italy the option to make the call on whether to issue refunds or vouchers.As I\u2019ve reported before, cash-strapped travel companies have numerous reasons for retaining non-refundable payments in the age of the coronavirus, and it\u2019s also not hard to understand why the owner of hotel in Italy \u2014 at an airport, no less \u2014 would choose that option, especially when expressly given the greenlight by the Italian government. Another reader bemoaned a similar issue, also with an Italian hotel. \u201cWhy is an American who never set foot on Italian soil subject to a new Italian decree?\u201d she wondered.In general, though, hotels have generally been better about Covid-related cash refunds than airlines, tour operators and cruise lines. In mid-March, as the world started shutting down, every major hotel company announced newly flexible cancellation terms, even for \u201cnon-refundable\u201d or \u201cadvance purchase\u201d reservations. And even now, as we move into summer, hotel policies remain pretty flexible. Hilton, for example, allows guests to cancel any reservation booked through August without penalty, so long as it\u2019s done so at least 24 hours before the arrival date. It\u2019s a strategic move meant to get people to take a leap, plan travel, book trips.Hilton\u2019s communications department has worked its magic \u2014 a spokeswoman for the brand has confirmed that Nick\u2019s refund is in process. And in a followup email, you told me that Best Western\u2019s Facebook customer-service team has offered you a gift card, which, unlike a rebooked stay, can be used at any of the company\u2019s hotels.I realize it\u2019s not quite the same as a cash refund, but amid an era when planning (and canceling) travel feels especially difficult and impersonal, measures like these can feel like a welcome human touch. Whatever you\u2019re drinking \u2014 be it beer or wine \u2014 I\u2019ll say cheers to that.The May 25 edition of Tripped Up, about widespread refund issues with a Boston-based tour operator, drew hundreds of reader responses. One, from a woman named Lisa, stuck with me: \u201cI love to travel and am very aware that many travel services companies are fighting for their lives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut as a customer, I am increasingly concerned about shouldering the bankruptcy risk of the tour operator. If they go bankrupt, those vouchers are worthless. It\u2019s a real dilemma, how to be supportive of travel companies yet not end up losing thousands.\u201dSarah Firshein is a Brooklyn-based writer.

The country\u2019s early railway system was a vital tool for economic growth, but it also abetted Canada\u2019s colonial mission. In addition to carrying goods and services, trains in Canada disseminated disease among the Indigenous communities on whose land this country was built. And while the country\u2019s railroads offered the possibility of expansion to some, for others they were harbingers of forced relocation.ImageElizabeth Rossignol waits for a lift to the train station in Schefferville.ImageA passenger waves as a group of students heads off for an educational camping trip.The fraught history of Canada\u2019s railways have made them a setting for political demonstrations, most recently against plans for a pipeline to be built through Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory in northern British Columbia.Tshiuetin has a different history. The company operates on the 360-mile line between Sept-\u00celes, a city on the northern shore of the Saint Lawrence River, and Schefferville, a remote town on the verge of the tundra in Quebec. (Tshiuetin owns 132.5 miles of that track \u2014 the stretch between Schefferville and Emeril Junction in Labrador \u2014 and manages passenger services for the entire line.)The rail line in autumn ...... and after nightfall.Schefferville was built by the Iron Ore Company of Canada to facilitate mining in the 1950s. After the closure of the area\u2019s I.O.C. mines in the 1980s, the company had no use for the northern portion of its railway. Since 2005, it has been run by the three First Nations that it connects: Uashat Mak Mani-utenam, Kawawachikamach and Matimekush-Lac John. With a mandated 85 percent Indigenous work force, Tshiuetin is now a symbol of reclamation and defiance for those it serves.ImageCynthia Pien travels on the southbound Tshiuetin train.ImageA passenger walks to his cabin after disembarking the Tshiuetin train. Without regularly scheduled stops between the railway\u2019s northern and southern termini, passengers notify train staff in advance of the mile at which they wish to disembark.Andy-Greg J\u00e9r\u00f4me, an Innu employee who joined Tshiuetin in 2012 at the age of 22, said the company gave him leadership experience. \u201cBest thing I did in my life,\u201d he said of his job. \u201cI am proud to work for a local company. I hope that in the future we can have more employees who come from the three communities.\u201dImageFamilies often bring blankets and sheets to cover their seats \u2014 along with food, drinks, phones, tablets and even the occasional monitor for group movie viewings or video games.The combined population of Schefferville and Matimekush-Lac John is around 800, and the Tshiuetin line plays a central role in the community. The passenger train normally completes its round-trip journey twice a week, with its estimated arrival times announced on the local Schefferville radio. (Since the town lies outside the country\u2019s provincial road network, a costly plane trip is the only alternative way in or out.)During the coronavirus pandemic, the frequency of trips has been limited, and restrictions have been placed on passengers\u2019 reasons for travel.ImageSchefferville was established in the 1950s by the Iron Ore Company of Canada to support nearby mining projects. The town had 4,500 residents then, as well as its own movie theatre, community centre, hospital, and Hudson\u2019s Bay department store.ImageBla Bla is a one of the few restaurants in Schefferville, and is frequented both by residents of Schefferville and nearby Kawawachikamach.ImageAfter the Schefferville I.O.C. mines closed in 1982 (due to falling iron-ore prices), workers moved elsewhere, and the town\u2019s population plummeted. The I.O.C. dismantled much of what it had built, leaving vast vacant lots where buildings used to be.On any given trip on the Tshiuetin train, most passengers are regulars. Some are heading to hunting grounds \u2014 like St\u00e9phane Lessard, whom I met en route to his friend\u2019s cabin, which he has been frequenting for 17 years.ImageSt\u00e9phane Lessard disembarks the Tshiuetin train en route to a friend\u2019s hunting cabin.ImageThe Jourdain family waits to board the Tshiuetin train at the side of the tracks after spending time at a cabin.Others are residents of Kawawachikamach or Matimekush-Lac John, near Schefferville, traveling south to appointments, or to shop in Sept-\u00celes, where goods are less expensive than they are up north.ImageThe Tshiuetin train winds its way through the boreal forest.Passengers might also be setting off on a holiday, with Sept-\u00celes as a point of departure \u2014 like Elayna Vollant-Einish and her family, whom I saw several times on the train, including after a celebratory trip to Qu\u00e9bec City to mark her brother Shane\u2019s high school graduation.ImageElayna Vollant-Einish, right, travels home from a family trip to celebrate her brother\u2019s high school graduation.On my many trips aboard the Tshiuetin train, I have met passengers like Gary Einish and Cynthia Pien, traveling with young children and equipped for the long day ahead. They bring whatever comforts they need to transform their seats into their own temporary living rooms.Gary Einish holds his cousin up to the window on a southbound trip to Sept-\u00celes, Quebec.The scenery draws a passenger\u2019s eyes away from the screen of her e-device.A young child gazes out the window on a foggy summer evening as the Tshiuetin train nears Sept-\u00celes.There aren\u2019t exactly formal stops between Schefferville and Sept-\u00celes; the only passengers who board or depart en route are either railway workers or those who have been at their hunting cabins, and who catch the train at the sides of the tracks. Along the route, the train becomes a sea of patterned sheets and blankets; passengers know the surrounding seats will likely be theirs for the duration of the journey.ImageOn a northbound journey, toward Schefferville.\u201cI feel like Kawawachikamach wouldn\u2019t be where it is today without the train,\u201d says Shane Vollant-Einish. \u201cIt\u2019s the lifeblood, the main artery for here.\u201dShane will soon set off on a cross-country trip to study in British Columbia, on Canada\u2019s West Coast. \u201cThe train won\u2019t be as important for me as it used to be. Instead of waiting every Thursday for fresh fruits and vegetables, they\u2019ll be available readily, and instead of waiting over two weeks for mail, it\u2019ll be next day,\u201d he said.ImageThe Tshiuetin railway tracks seen from Schefferville, across Knob Lake.\u201cI guess the train will symbolize how willing we are to live in ancestral lands and walk on the same hills and ice covered lakes as our forefathers did,\u201d he added. \u201cThe train always will mean home for me.\u201dChlo\u00eb Ellingson is a documentary photographer who lives in Toronto.

It Could Be Better.", "summary": "The pandemic crushed the tourism industry in Venice and other overtouristed cities. But many see this as an opportunity to rethink a \u201ctourism monoculture.\u201d", "authors": "By Anna Momigliano", "text": "Long before Venice became the destination of choice for millions of international holidaymakers, locals had a tradition of fl\u00e2nerie, an aimless stroll through the city\u2019s calli, or walkways. They would bump into acquaintances for a chat and the occasional drink, an ombra de vin, a \u201cshadow of wine,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the lagoon.That tradition has been picked up again. The pandemic crushed the tourism industry, curtailing the hordes of annual visitors that made fl\u00e2nerie a near impossibility, and now many residents \u2014 particularly those furloughed or laid off \u2014 have more time and space to enjoy the city\u2019s slow pace and faded beauty. But money is tight, for that sip of wine and everything else. Local taverns have begun accepting promises of future payments from regulars.\u201cPeople are like, I\u2019ll pay you in September, when hopefully tourists will be back,\u201d said Matteo Secchi, an unemployed hotel concierge. \u201cIf we don\u2019t help each other, who will?\u201dMr. Secchi, a native Venetian, started working in tourism when he was still in high school, 30 years ago. \u201cMy first job was to escort tourists from hotels to Murano\u2019s glass shops,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I can remember, tourism has been our only economy, we thought it was a bottomless well, like oil for the Saudis.\u201dVenice certainly wasn\u2019t alone. The economies of other European cities \u2014 Barcelona, Prague and others \u2014 grew to rely heavily on tourism, leaving them now particularly exposed to the side effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.But there\u2019s a new feeling many residents and local travel operators share: The crisis creates an opportunity to make future travel to and in their cities and regions more sustainable. This crossroads is sparking conversations on how to make tourism less taxing and more beneficial on urban infrastructure and for its local inhabitants.In Venice, residents and local leaders hope their city can develop an economy that doesn\u2019t revolve entirely around tourism, one that would draw international investors, expand the footprint of the city\u2019s two universities and turn its empty buildings into environmental research facilities.Yes, the pandemic has shuttered Venice\u2019s lodging industry, said Claudio Scarpa, the president of Associazione Veneziana Albergatori, a body representing 430 hotels in Venice, but \u201cit is also a precious occasion to rethink tourism.\u201d\u201cThis is the time to reclaim this city,\u201d he said, \u201cOr in a couple of years we\u2019ll get back to complaining about overtourism.\u201dOther Venetians echoed that sentiment.\u201cWe have to act now, before mass tourism will be back at full capacity, because we won\u2019t get a second chance,\u201d said Paolo Costa, a former mayor of Venice and an economics professor who also served as the dean of Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice.ImageUsually held every September, the Regata Storica celebrates\u00a0Venetian rowing, with historical costumes and rowing races.Credit...Clara Vannucci for The New York TimesAn attraction for centuriesThe uniqueness of this Italian city has made it a worldwide attraction for centuries. And, tellingly, Venice\u2019s rise as a travel destination coincided with its decline as an economic powerhouse, said Ezio Micelli, an expert of urban transformation at Iuav University of Venice.As a city-state, Venice thrived as a commercial and financial hub for much of the Middle Ages. Its location midway between Constantinople and Western Europe made it an ideal junction for the trade of spices, silk and salt. \u201cIt was the capital of capitalism,\u201d Mr. Micelli said.But as the center of trade moved from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, Venice lost centrality and by the end of the 18th century, when it fell under foreign rule, its decline was unstoppable. It was then that wealthy Europeans started visiting Italy\u2019s art-rich cities, including Venice, in a tradition known as \u201cthe Grand Tour.\u201d Lord Byron and Stendhal were among the city\u2019s earliest holidaymakers. By the 19th century, Venice\u2019s Lido became the place of pilgrimage for Europe\u2019s well-off bourgeoise (think of Thomas Mann\u2019s \u201cDeath in Venice\u201d).But by the late 20th century, Venice became what economists describe as a \u201ctourism monoculture,\u201d borrowing the term from the risky agricultural practice of growing a single crop.ImageCrowds of tourists swarm Riva degli Schiavoni, by St. Mark\u2019s Square.Credit...Susan Wright for The New York Times\u2018Too many of them\u2019Before Covid-19, hotels in and around Venice annually hosted 10.2 million mostly international guests, according to Italy\u2019s bureau of statistics. But this figure \u2014 an estimate at best \u2014 does not account for day-trippers, who disembark from cruise ships, the train station and bus tours. One estimate puts the actual number of tourists around 20 million annually \u2014 largely concentrated in an area of two square miles and 50,000 residents. They contributed 3 billion euros, or about $3.3 billion, a year.\u201cTourists grew gradually, year by year, and before we realized it, there were too many of them, just like a boiling frog,\u201d Mr. Micelli said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/travel/coronavirus-cruises-reopening.html", "title": "The Post-Coronavirus Cruise? Not Ready to Sail", "summary": "Data shows that there were far more cases of Covid-19 on cruise ships than have been reported, but the companies and the C.D.C. have yet to establish how the boats can come back.", "authors": "By Frances Robles", "text": "W. Bradford Gary spent 10 days trapped inside a cruise ship cabin off the coast of Brazil in March while health authorities in several countries scrambled to figure out what to do with a vessel full of older people who had potentially been exposed to the coronavirus.But when faced with the question of whether he\u2019d ever cruise again, he doesn\u2019t hesitate.\u201cWe are very anxious to get back on board,\u201d he said, and he believes he\u2019s not alone: \u201cThere are people like us who want to do this.\u201dMr. Gary, 70, a retired corporate executive who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., imagines the cruise ship of the near future equipped with special disinfecting ultraviolet lights and air flow contraptions commonly used in sterile laboratories. He envisions larger cabins, fewer passengers and a lot more outdoor spaces. \u201cWe want to know everything is safe,\u201d he said.That is a big order.With more than 20 million passengers a year, the $45 billion global cruise industry has a particularly vexing challenge: Its most loyal customers, older people, also happen to be the key demographic at risk for the new illness that has swept the planet, killing more than 450,000 people. Cruises also have the very things that help the coronavirus spread: large gatherings, confined spaces and workers who live in tight shared quarters.More than three months after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a no sail order for all United States cruises, interviews with health officials, loyal passengers, industry experts, cruise executives and maritime lawyers made clear that restarting operations would require rethinking cruising itself \u2014 from the number of passengers onboard to how they are fed, housed and entertained \u2014 and that the government and the cruise lines are not close to figuring it out.Last week, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the cruise industry\u2019s trade group, said that it was voluntarily extending the no sail period from U.S. ports until Sept. 15. Earlier, Carnival Corporation, the world\u2019s biggest cruise company, had suggested that it could start sailings by Aug. 1.According to Martin Cetron, the C.D.C.\u2019s director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, cruise ships offer fertile ground for the \u201cseeding, amplification, and dissemination\u201d of Covid-19, worsened by the fact that crew members often transfer from one ship to another, taking diseases with them.Breaking that chain of infection is key.But as restaurants, casinos, movie theaters and theme parks are poised to reopen, with plans in place to prevent the spread of the highly infectious disease, the cruise industry has not publicly laid out its strategy.Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for CLIA, said, \u201cThe cruise industry is taking a holistic approach to planning for Covid-19 safety, when sailing is allowed, that would ideally entail a door-to-door strategy beginning at the time of booking through the passengers\u2019 return home.\u201dShe said cruise ships are already cleaned several times a day, but the industry is using the time off to rethink everything from offshore excursions to enhanced medical capabilities onboard and evacuations.As to setting out highly detailed plans for what a post-pandemic cruise might look like, \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d she said.ImagePier 92, center, is part of the Manhattan Cruise Terminal, from which ocean-going ships depart.

Passengers were stranded for weeks while people on board got sick and were quarantined in their staterooms. A Miami Herald analysis showed at least 80 people died worldwide.New data from the C.D.C., released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The Times shows that more than 100 ships in the U.S. jurisdiction alone had outbreaks on board, sickening nearly 3,000 people, including more than 850 passengers.

In hundreds of responses, people told us about their fears and worries, but they also shared stories of a pastime they\u2019ve enjoyed with grandparents, parents, children and friends.Many people said that their families used the Green Book, a guidebook first published in 1936 that listed welcoming towns, motels and restaurants for black travelers; others said that trips require a lot of planning and little spontaneity.

We are from the Bronx and we would take road trips to indoor water parks like Great Wolf Lodge and were always stopped. It would cause us extreme anxiety. The cops would be so aggressive toward our mother and we would be still in the car waiting to see what would happen. To this day, as young adults, when going for road trips to the lakes or Lake George we are always looking out the window, actively worried. It is a lifestyle, this worry and anxiety about the cops.\u2014 Thalia Rodriguez, Bronx, N.Y.\u2018This land is my land, and I plan to drive every mile of it.\u2019ImageJoshua Lawrence Lazard\u2019s friends at the Oak Alley Plantation, in Louisiana, in March 2014.Credit...Joshua Lawrence LazardMy parents always told me stories of the perils of \u201croad tripping while Black,\u201d but it never stopped us from going on road trips as a family. To this day, I have a pretty good interstate map in my head. At least twice a year I end up taking a trip of 12 hours or more. I probably worry about being a solo traveler more than being a black traveler. I\u2019m always aware of my surroundings because being solo just makes me more of a target. I generally stick to the Interstate System, and when I do venture on back roads, I try to avoid stopping for gas or bathroom breaks. The prevalence of Confederate flags mounted on porches and flying in yards in the rural South still chills me to my core. I have logged miles through the dense fog of the Appalachian Mountains, the humid heat of the Deep South and the frozen prairies of Illinois, and I don\u2019t see any reason to stop now. This land is my land, and I plan to drive every mile of it.\u2014 Joshua Lawrence Lazard, Raleigh, N.C.\u2018It makes you wary, all the time\u2019ImageValerie Johnson (bottom-left) on vacation with her family.Credit...Valerie JohnsonIn about 1971 in Georgia, the skies opened up on our family trip back home to North Carolina from our vacation in Florida, so when we saw the glowing red vacancy sign, we were elated. We pulled up close to the door and a man came out in a trench coat with a big umbrella, a welcoming smile on his face. But as soon as the inside light popped on, revealing my mother, father, brother and me as black, the man\u2019s smile vanished. He signaled \u201cno\u201d with his hand and retreated. The last thing I saw through the rain-streaked window was the \u201cno\u201d flickering on in front of \u201cvacancy\u201d as we pulled out of the mostly empty parking lot. I was only 6 or 7 but I knew what had happened.This summer I need to accompany my daughter on her move to California. There are states where I am not comfortable on the roads. I am always afraid that the police will stop me. I am afraid that I will be accused of doing something and the fact that I am a middle-aged lawyer won\u2019t save me. And I am wary of stopping at establishments in towns where I might not be wanted. That is what racism does. It makes you wary, all the time, so we will likely fly despite the risks of airplane travel.\u2014 Valerie Johnson, Durham, N.C.\u2018Unless I\u2019m with my white friends, I won\u2019t stop\u2019ImageTyler Beckworth, with his fiancee at Zion National Park in Utah, February\u00a0 2018.\u00a0Credit...Tyler BeckworthRoad trips have always been a passion of mine and I will certainly plan a few this summer. However, being a black male has and will continue to keep certain places off limits in my mind. Rolling through a small town and stopping in the local bar has always intrigued me, but unless I\u2019m with my white friends, I won\u2019t stop. There\u2019s simply no knowing who is in there. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed out on a great bar with great people. But it\u2019s not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\u2014 Tyler Beckworth., Los Angeles, Calif.\u2018I sweat every detail\u2019My friends, who are mostly white, have a freedom in making travel plans I never will. I sweat every detail from where we stop for gas, spend the night, even the side roads and detours we take.I refuse to let fear dictate the choices I make, but there are limits to how much protection even the most abundant caution and vigilance can provide. I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky and never had a racial incident while driving, but I wonder with every trip whether or not this is the time my luck runs out.\u2014 Spencer Gilbert, New York, N.Y.\u2018We did not experience any overt hatred\u2019ImageApril Banks during her 2010 cross-country bicycle ride from San Francisco to Washington D.C..I have taken multiple short and long road trips across America, including one bicycle ride from San Francisco to Washington D.C., exactly 10 years ago this June. Of all my international travels, it was the bicycle trip across America that worried my friends and family the most. Two black women on bicycles riding through Middle America. We were highly visible and had lots of interactions with other travelers and folks in small-town America. Our awareness was heightened, but we did not experience any overt hatred. We did experience many acts of kindness, like a ride into town during a hailstorm. Or when a white police chief in a small town let us camp in his backyard because the only motel in town said they had \u201cno vacancy.\u201d We heard many opinions from native, black, white and immigrant communities about our ride and about their politics. We saw signs protesting Obama. Mostly people were shocked and curious to see us.\u2014 April Banks, Los Angeles, Calif.\u2018Never had any issues\u2019ImageSam Tyler on a trip to Yosemite National Park in 2017.I am a 39-year-old black male who has traveled all around the U.S.A. and in 13 countries. In all of my road trips, I have never really been afraid to travel because of my race. There are times when I stop in small rural towns (especially in the South) for gas or at welcome stops where I can tell my presence as a black male is not welcome. The biggest risks, in my opinion, for black travelers are state troopers who see us as targets for stops. I will never let the racism of a few deter me from traveling, as during most of my traveling I have never had any issues. I think it is important to stay aware while not being afraid.\u2014 Sam Tyler, Atlanta, Ga.\u2018We\u2019ve always made it beautiful\u2019ImageJerilyn D. Williams as a child (center) during a family reunion in Ohio in the summer of 1973.As a young girl in the 1970s, I always looked forward to our annual summer road trip to Tennessee for my grandfather\u2019s family reunion. One of the best treats of the weekend was the huge picnic lunch my grandmother would prepare for our trip down I-65. Mom (as my sisters and I called our grandmother) would fry chicken and make potato salad, meatloaf, poundcake and more. There would be six or seven cars full of Walkers and Wards heading south to Centerville, and we\u2019d all stop at that same rest area in Kentucky for lunch. Then we\u2019d pile back into our respective cars and make our way down the interstate.It didn\u2019t dawn on me until I was in my 20s why my family had this established tradition. My grandmother made and packed lunch for her three children during the 1950s and \u201960s when they would trek to the South. My grandparents were painfully aware of the South\u2019s Jim Crow customs and unwritten laws (even in the 1970s and \u201980s). They knew, although laws had changed since the Civil Rights Movement, laws don\u2019t change hearts and minds.The mid-trip picnics I enjoyed so much as a child began out of necessity, not from choice.Even though racism and bigotry were the catalysts for my family\u2019s tradition, we have lovingly turned it into something warming and familial. That\u2019s what my ancestors have always done: We\u2019ve always been given the scraps, the leftovers, the remnants; and we\u2019ve always made it beautiful, covetous, delicious.\u2014 Jerilyn D.

But few plans are as complex as those surrounding the food-and-beverage industry, one of the harder hit sectors in these months of Covid-19-driven shutdowns.Much talk has focused on bars and restaurants and the complicated geometry required to reopen safely. But what of the food-and-drink-centered businesses, many of them aimed at travelers, that fall outside that purview? These wineries, breweries, distilleries, farm stays, food halls, cooking classes and food tours, face similar challenges with added factors, including changing rules across state lines, and business plans that predominantly cater to out-of-towners.We asked several of these businesses around the United States how they\u2019re pivoting to reopen now and in the weeks and months ahead.Image\u201cThe Crick has always been a community space where people connect with each other,\u201d said Bertony Faustin, the winemaker and owner of Abbey Creek Vineyard in Oregon, whose tasting room is called The Crick. \u201cWe\u2019re about hip-hop, wine and chill, in that order.\u201d He said he hopes to do the same thing, with fewer people.Credit...The CrickOutdoor seating, reservations-onlyWineries, breweries and distilleries are attempting to reimagine the tasting-room experience. For many, that means moving operations outdoors.Flowers Vineyard in Sonoma County, Calif., known for its coastal chardonnay and Pinot Noir, is utilizing its outdoor space for a largely \u201ctouchless\u201d experience. Wineries received approval from the county to reopen starting May 23, provided that groups are limited to six people, social distancing rules are followed and food is served. Flowers, which reopened June 12, is offering new tasting packages that include paired \u201cprovisions\u201d boxes from nearby Sonoma County restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Single Thread.Guests make advance reservations for two-hour windows, prepay online and are greeted by a mask-wearing host \u201cfrom a safe distance,\u201d explained the general manager, Stephanie Peachey. \u201cYou\u2019ll be guided to your designated patio seating. At each person\u2019s table, you\u2019ll have a bottle of wine, an ice bucket, if needed, and food pairings from our restaurant partners.\u201dStarting in July, the Flowers team is planning to offer a more traditional tasting experience, in which a flight of three wines are poured by an employee, also wearing a mask. But bottle service will remain an option for those who are uncomfortable with that degree of contact.The winery anticipates that it will be able to host about 12 groups at a time, with tables seating two to six people. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how we can provide a low-contact experience that\u2019s still meaningful,\u201d said Ms. Peachey.Creating a meaningful experience that still captures the spirit of his brand is front-of-mind for Bertony Faustin, the winemaker and owner of Abbey Creek Vineyard. Based in North Plains, Ore., Abbey Creek\u2019s tasting room, The Crick, was never centered around traditional wine tasting, with its family-style dinners and brunches, and monthly art nights featuring D.J.s and hip-hop performers.\u201cThe Crick has always been a community space where people connect with each other,\u201d Mr. Faustin said. \u201cWe\u2019re about hip-hop, wine and chill, in that order.\u201d He said he hopes to do the same thing, with fewer people.Making use of the Crick\u2019s outdoor patio, Mr. Faustin is planning on offering three reservations-only seatings on Saturdays and Sundays, for 20 to 25 people each. There will be a half-hour window between seatings, allowing time to wipe down surfaces and sanitize restrooms. This approach will also apply to Abbey Creek\u2019s new tasting room in downtown Portland, which Mr. Faustin is opening in July.Jester King Brewery, just outside Austin, Texas, is utilizing a similar, staggered reservation model to safely get guests placed and seated at its 165-acre brewery and ranch; it reopened on May 29.\u201cWe have tables in our hopyard and vineyard, even by our goat pen,\u201d said Jeffrey Stuffings, the founder and owner.Guests book online for one of three two-hour sessions. Food and beer orders are also placed online and picked up at one of two tents. Everyone is requested to wear masks when not eating or drinking; all cups, utensils and food service items are disposable and compostable. Between each session, the brewery sanitizes tables.One thing that isn\u2019t in the cards yet, said Mr. Stuffings, are tours of the brewing operation and farm.ImageTo assure social distancing among both visitors and employees, New Riff Distilling in Kentucky is resuming tours on days when the production team is not in the building.Credit...Hannah LowenThe distillery\u2019s dilemmaTours are also proving to be a hurdle for the distilling community.\u201cDistilleries want to protect their workers as much as possible,\u201d said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association. Tours, he said, are generally up close and personal, and may not be worth the risk. Some larger distilleries, including Angel\u2019s Envy, plan on reducing tour size, while others are suspending tours entirely, at least for the time being.\u201cThe fear is that someone brings the virus into the production area on a tour, and our staff has to go into quarantine,\u201d said Jay Erisman, a co-founder of New Riff Distilling. New Riff is planning on resuming tours this week on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays when the production team is not in the building.In addition to requiring self-administered employee screenings, New Riff has rearranged its bottling line to ensure social distancing for workers. Its gift shop is open for on-premise sales to a limited number of guests at a time, with cashless payments and masked employees. Face masks are required for tours, and recommended in the gift shop. Tastings, with disposable cups, will follow soon.Many of those strategies can be found in the 30-page plan put together by the group that runs the Kentucky Bourbon Trail tours, The Distiller\u2019s Association, a collection of 37 distilleries organized in road-trip-friendly itineraries throughout the state. The organization got word that distilleries would be allowed to open gift shops with no on-site consumption on May 20, and on June 8 for limited tastings and tours. But according to Mr. Gregory, timelines are varying between individual distilleries.\u201cI know several of the larger distilleries are waiting to mid-June or later to ramp up again,\u201d he said. Figuring out best practices is still a work in progress.One thing that the distilleries are well stocked in? Hand sanitizer. \u201cWe make our own \u2026 heck, we sell the stuff!\u201d Mr. Erisman said.Transitioning to hand sanitizer production was a major initiative at Du Nord Craft Spirits, a microdistillery based in South Minneapolis and the first black-owned distillery in the United States. Run by a husband-and-wife team, Chris and Shanelle Montana, Du Nord produces vodka, gin and whiskey and has a cocktail room. The Montanas were starting to think about reopening midsummer when mass protests surrounding the death of George Floyd overtook the neighborhood.\u201cWe are very involved in the South Minneapolis community and we wanted to play our part,\u201d said Shanelle Montana. \u201cWe were handing out hand sanitizer and water to the crowd.\u201dAs the protests continued, the Montanas began putting contingency plans in place, especially as violence increased. The warehouse space was broken into, but the resulting small fires were promptly extinguished by their sprinkler system. The cocktail room was spared \u2014 Ms. Montana believes that was because the employees wrote \u201cblack-owned business\u201d on the space\u2019s windows.Ms. Montana is heartened by the support they have received from the community in cleaning up and repurposing the warehouse as a temporary food pantry. Their next steps are to renovate the building.\u201cWe\u2019re making sure that any space we have will be able to adapt to whatever Covid restrictions are required,\u201d Ms. Montana said. Perhaps more pressing in their future plans is a commitment to reinvesting in their community and existing as a healing gathering space. \u201cIn some ways, we have a clean slate to reimagine what it could be.\u201dCooking schools and tours: targeting localsFor BLVD Kitchen, which offers cooking classes, events and catering services in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, the immediate impact of Covid-19 and \u201cSafer at Home\u201d orders was devastating.\u201cPretty much all of our lines of business disappeared overnight,\u201d said the proprietor, Sharon Graves. BLVD Kitchen\u2019s customers were primarily local and initial recovery efforts, including preparing and selling \u201cQuarantine Cuisine,\u201d targeted that base. But as offerings expanded to a regular roster of online cooking classes, so has the geographic diversity of BLVD\u2019s clients.\u201cIt\u2019s really enabled us to go beyond our neighborhood,\u201d said Ms. Graves. \u201cWe have people from the Midwest, New York and San Francisco.\u201dWhile Los Angeles is beginning to reopen, Ms. Graves is not eager to rush back into in-person cooking classes. For now, she is planning an in-person children\u2019s camp in August.One thing that might be a permanent change: the online curriculum. \u201cI\u2019m considering converting part of the kitchen into a studio for online learning,\u201d Ms. Graves said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as being here, but there is something magical about cooking together online.\u201dCulinary Backstreets, a publisher and culinary-tour business focusing on street food and small, family-run businesses, is similarly trying to find ways to expand its appeal to both locals and out-of-towners in its 14 cities worldwide. Currently, the company is hoping to apply what it has learned from efforts made in European cities in more advanced opening phases to its business in New York City, which focuses on international food culture in Queens.One new initiative is their \u201cSave Your Seat\u201d donation program. In Queens, the culinary tour leader Esneider Arevalo is working on nonperishable food boxes from businesses in the borough that will be available for shipping throughout the United States.When tours resume \u2014 hopefully, later this summer \u2014 they\u2019ll be available on a private basis to start, with adjustments made to avoid restaurants at peak times and keep everyone outside as much as possible.But this fragmented reopening just isn\u2019t worth it for all business owners.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in just having four or five people on a tour, or trying to resume business until it\u2019s safe. I\u2019m going to be on the conservative side,\u201d said Lynn Jaynes, the founder of Tastebud Tours, which operates in Chicago, San Francisco and New Orleans.According to Tiffany Jaynes Black, Mr. Jaynes\u2019 daughter and Tastebud\u2019s director of sales and marketing, the company is tentatively resuming business in August or September, but that may be \u201cwishful thinking.\u201dAt Eataly, relying on backup plansLike Culinary Backstreets, the Italian marketplace Eataly will look to its European locations for insights; its market halls in Italy and Germany have recently opened their restaurants for dine-in business.\u201cThe valuable insights we learn from these reopenings will support our U.S. stores on how to open operationally, with increased social distancing and sanitary measures,\u201d said Nicola Farinetti, Eataly\u2019s global chief executive officer.While indoor restaurants, food counters and cooking classes remain closed at locations in New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, Eataly\u2019s marketplaces have remained open throughout shelter-in-place (Eataly Las Vegas, in a Park MGM property, has remained closed) and restaurants at Eataly locations in Boston and Los Angeles have opened for outdoor dining.The built-in diversification of Eataly\u2019s business model has not only given the business a leg to stand on, it\u2019s provided, \u201ca lifeline for many small, Italian and local artisanal producers,\u201d Mr. Farinetti said.ImageAt Leaping Lamb Farm in Oregon, social distancing is built into the expansive surroundings and widely spaced lodgings.Credit...Melissa CarrollFarm stays: back to the basicsThe ability to rely on a core business is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the farm-stay business \u2014 the hospitality sector might offset a bad farming year, and vice versa.\u201cFarming is always risky,\u201d said Scottie Jones, the owner of Leaping Lamb Farm in Alsea, Ore. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened for a lot of us this year is that their hospitality has crashed, but the farming sector has picked up, thanks to requests for goods.\u201dMs. Jones has been offering farm stays since 2007. Her cottage and a farmhouse tend to be booked by families, the majority from Seattle, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco.While all of her guests canceled in March and April \u2014 lambing season, usually a busy time \u2014 Ms. Jones has received multiple calls for reservations in the summer and fall. But despite the rapid clip of incoming reservations, and new initiatives like locally delivered lamb boxes, Leaping Lamb lost about $30,000 in business this spring.It\u2019s far from alone. Ms. Jones, the founder and executive director of the U.S. Farm Stay Association, recently conducted a survey of the impact of Covid-19 on business. Of the 71 responses (out of 130 members), Ms. Jones observed that about 60 percent have not seen reservations pick up since restrictions began to loosen in recent weeks. She speculates that the ones suffering the most are larger ranches that attract out-of-state or international guests that stay for weeks at a time.The fact that the vast majority of Ms. Jones\u2019s customer base is within driving distance has made for a faster road to recovery. She hosted her first guests in mid-May, with some key changes.\u201cWhen we take people to their unit, we\u2019re wearing masks. After that, it\u2019s kind of up to them,\u201d she said, noting that the expansiveness of the farm is helpful in maintaining social distance.Ms. Jones has recently had guests at both the cottage and the farmhouse simultaneously (the buildings are more than 500 feet apart). She has rescinded her cancellation policy, and in general, guests can expect 24- to 96-hour windows between stays.And she is still letting everyone help with the chores, separately. \u201cWe\u2019re in big open spaces! I can pretty easily point at some hay and say, \u2018Go feed the horses.\u2019 But it\u2019s certainly different,\u201d she said. \u201cMy business tends to be more around hugs, walking close, holding hands with the kids.

Built in 1899, the 3,600-square-foot landmarked building had been abandoned for over 20 years, and while its oversize backyard and sweeping Douglas fir staircase remained grand and inviting, the paint was peeling, the plaster was crumbling and the red oak floors were coated in two decades\u2019 worth of grime. Each half of the couple independently sourced suggestions for an architect, asking their respective friends and family members for recommendations. But when they reconvened, each prepared to argue for their own incontestable pick, they found themselves blurting out the same name: Michael Chen.ImageIn the parlor-level living room, a mustard yellow Ligne Roset Togo sofa and Doug Johnston rope stool offset a low, stacked Cloud table by Nendo for Moroso.Credit...Alan TanseyImageChen crafted the living-room fireplace from blocks of Calacatta Nero and Arabescato Ovulato marble in a modern, asymmetric arrangement.Credit...Alan TanseyChen, the founder of Michael K. Chen Architecture (MKCA), is known for his devotion to craft and sense of playfulness, and, like the owners, he was dazzled by the home\u2019s existing palette: Flaking off the walls in various rooms were fragments of turquoise, celadon, raspberry, emerald green and dramatic stormy blue paint. He knew immediately that rich color would become an organizing principle of the renovation. \u201cIn a lot of brownstone projects, one tends to see restorations of original details and then everything is painted white,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were collectively not interested in that approach.\u201d For Chen, color is a \u201cdeeply immersive condition\u201d \u2014 a defining aspect of a space that creates an architectural framework of its own. (\u201cMy least favorite design expression is \u2018pop of color,\u2019\u201d he says.) And so, he decided to use color to tell a larger story within the home: While each room would be set apart from the others by its own unique shade, together these bold hues \u2014 more modern odes to the paints he\u2019d discovered than exact recreations \u2014 would layer his architectural signature, along with the vibrant personalities of the home\u2019s new owners, onto this pedigreed building without overwriting its history.ImageA Discus pendant by Jamie Gray hangs in the parlor-floor hallway.Credit...Alan TanseyWith this bold chromatic scheme as their starting point, Chen and his team worked closely with the artist owner to devise an aesthetic that felt personal to her and her husband. Chen wanted to incorporate the pair\u2019s appreciation for midcentury modernism, and for the delightfully kitschy: She collects works of art modeled after food and provided Chen with design references that included stills from Wes Anderson movies, along with a request for at least one element borrowed from Blanche Devereaux\u2019s flamboyant Florida home in the \u201980s-era TV show \u201cThe Golden Girls.\u201d A specialist in figurative line drawings, watercolors and giant, plush fabric sculptures, the artist asked, too, for places to display some of her own work, such as a group of eight-inch-tall ceramic renderings of human teeth and irreverent paintings of bodybuilders. In the finished home, the bright walls create a striking backdrop for these and other offbeat pieces, like a pair of works in felt by the British artist Lucy Sparrow, shaped like a can of Spam and a package of hot dogs, respectively, which hang against a butter yellow wall in the kitchen.ImageThe parlor-floor powder room has a Martinique banana-leaf-print wall covering and a custom walnut-frame mirror from the Brooklyn furniture maker Bower.Credit...Alan TanseyImageIn the library, the Ib Kofod-Larsen Penguin chair and Dorothee Becker wall organizer exemplify the couple\u2019s love of midcentury design. The white oak console and shelving are by MKCA.Credit...Alan TanseyPerhaps nowhere in the home is the color more brilliant than in the living room, a 300-square-foot space at the back of the parlor floor with an elegant bay window overlooking the lush garden, planted by Brook Landscape with foxgloves, acanthus, birch trees and a towering magnolia tree. Once magenta, the room\u2019s walls \u2014 as well as its ceiling, moldings and baseboards \u2014 are now a calming shade of desaturated terra cotta (Benjamin Moore\u2019s Palazzo Pink). While Chen\u2019s firm went to great lengths to preserve the home\u2019s historical details, precisely recreating the original carved moldings that were too damaged to be saved, he didn\u2019t want them to become the subject of this room; finishing each surface in a single color softened their presence and heightened the experiential effect of being enveloped in a field of pink. To further bridge past and present, Chen refashioned the fireplace \u2014 formerly an unornamented, blackened-brick hole-in-the-wall \u2014 into a defiantly modern, asymmetrical structure made from two giant black-and-white marble slabs. And to make the scale of the room, which has 11-foot-tall ceilings, feel more intimate, he installed an Astro Mobile chandelier by Andrew Neyer and purposefully chose only low-slung furniture, including a modular forest green velvet sofa by Tufty Time, which gives the space a more cozy, laid-back mood.ImageA 12-foot-long avocado green kitchen island is topped with a tinted concrete counter in the vibrant, color-blocked kitchen.Credit...Alan TanseyImageOn the home\u2019s lowest level, concrete floor tiles accentuate the connection between the interior and exterior living spaces.Credit...Alan TanseyHowever adventurous in color, though, each room of the house retains its functionality. On the fourth floor, a bathroom conceived of with the owners\u2019 future children in mind is covered from floor to ceiling with blazing red Heath Ceramics tiles so that the inevitable splashes won\u2019t ruin the walls. And the butterscotch orange library, which sits just off the parlor floor\u2019s front entryway, was designed as a work-from-home area, with a slim-legged black-oak-and-ash Ligne Roset desk and a sculptural wall-mounted plastic organizer by Dorothee Becker for stashing pens and stray paper clips. Only the 265-square-foot master bedroom, on the third floor, is finished in neutral shades. Chen intended the gray and white walls to lend a sense of calm to the space where the couple unwinds each night \u2014 even if a geometric-patterned bedspread by the Brooklyn textile brand Dusen Dusen Home and a handwoven cerulean Moroccan rug still provide hints of color.ImageIn the lounge on the ground floor, a Flos 265 swing-arm lamp hangs above a blue wool sofa and nesting tables by Muuto.Credit...Alan TanseyThe ground floor, meanwhile, holds the home\u2019s kitchen and an adjacent lounge with three glass doors that lead to a 285-square-foot sunken patio. To divide this level into distinct spaces for different uses, Chen created a vivid gradient effect across the entire floor using custom encaustic concrete tiles from the Cement Tile Shop. Assembled in tumbling-block patterns from 2,800 tiles in 17 unique color schemes, the grid transitions from a combination of black, white and blue at the home\u2019s front entrance, to green and pink hues in the kitchen and indoor lounge area, to red and ocher for the exterior terrace. Furnishings in bold shades help to further define the kitchen: Lacquered oxblood cabinetry designates the cooking and storage zone, while a 12-foot-long avocado green rectangular lacquered island with a concrete countertop and Nerd bar stools by Muuto serves as a central gathering point for a quick breakfast or impromptu drinks during dinner prep as the light that streams in through the seven-foot-tall glass doors begins to fade.ImageIn the master bathroom, a double-height light well and skylight bathe the tub in a peach-tinted glow.Credit...Alan TanseyImageChen framed a new skylight above the top-floor landing with a dramatic, sculptural ceiling recess. A pendant lamp by Lukas Peet hangs over the stairwell.Credit...Alan TanseyElsewhere, Chen oversaw structural changes to make the most of the natural light. Brownstones are typically darkest at their centers, and so he added two inventive skylights to the roof. In the master bathroom, a rectangular double-height light well \u2014 which Chen describes as a \u201cnegative prism\u201d and is painted in a soft peach \u2014 bathes the large, free-standing oval bathtub in a warm glow no matter the time of day. \u201cWe took a note from James Turrell,\u201d Chen explains, referring to the American Light and Space movement artist known for manipulating beams of light to create three-dimensional projected sculptures. \u201cThe idea was to define a volume of light that feels as if it\u2019s sort of punched down and into the floor.\u201d In another nod to Turrell, on the fourth floor, he installed a 10-foot-wide skylight above the uppermost landing of the main staircase. The aperture, which was fashioned by recessing two overlapping conical depressions into the ceiling, allows natural light to descend through the stairwell via what appears to be a flying-saucer-shaped opening to the heavens.ImageIn the couple\u2019s bedroom, a cane sculpture of a bull\u2019s head, which they bought on a trip to Spain, complements a bed dressed with colorful linens from Dusen Dusen Home and a Moroccan rug.Credit...Alan TanseyImageChen designed a new, ribbonlike steel handrail for the staircase that connects the ground and parlor floors.Credit...Alan TanseyImageA top-floor bathroom is clad from floor to ceiling in fiery red handmade tiles from Heath Ceramics.Credit...Alan TanseyIn order to reflect the color of the sky downward and into the home, Chen painted the entire stairwell the same shade of atmospheric gray-blue. As such, the center of the house is unified by an unbroken expanse of color, illuminated from above. At the foot of the staircase, though, Chen still had to devise a way of transitioning from the traditionally preserved parlor level to the more contemporary kitchen floor below. To achieve this, he conceived of a visual caesura \u2014 a break in the architectural language of the staircase itself. He removed the lowermost section of the original wooden balustrade and replaced it with a custom railing of his own design, a thin steel handrail that features a looping, ribbonlike banister and leads down to the kitchen. And, as is true throughout the home, it is color that connects present and the past. To match the dark, metallic shade of his modern addition, Chen finished the balusters, handrail and newel of the restored original staircase in an inky black Farrow & Ball paint called, quite simply, Railings. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Chen says, \u201cyou receive instructions from the universe, and you just follow them.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/t-magazine/catherine-opie-photos.html", "title": "From Catherine Opie, a Visual Diary of the Recent Past", "summary": "The celebrated photographer shares her snapshots of a time of togetherness.", "authors": "By Nadja Spiegelman", "text": "The photographer Catherine Opie has always been interested in the subversively domestic. In one of her best-known early works, \u201cSelf-Portrait/Cutting\u201d (1993), her naked back is carved with a still-bleeding childlike drawing of a home, two women stick-figures in the foreground. That image, now in the Guggenheim\u2019s permanent collection, nods to the queer B.D.S.M. scene in which Opie found community in the \u201990s, while capturing the painful longing she felt for a family of her own. Queer domesticity was a radical thing to envision at the time, but three decades later, the pandemic has confined Opie to the Los Angeles home she now shares with her wife, Julie Burleigh, and their 18-year-old son, Oliver. Their daughter, Sara, whom Julie had when she was young, and their 6-year-old grandson, Joaquin, visit often, though for the first few months of quarantine, even that was off-limits. The house has art scattered across the mantles and climbing up to the high ceilings, some of it from famous friends, and some, like the children\u2019s drawings on the fridge, simply a reminder that once it arrives, family grows as unwieldy and resilient as the 90-year-old Aleppo pine tree in the yard.When T sent Opie an instant Fujifilm camera with which to document this strange spring, she was in the midst of preparing a show, \u201cRhetorical Landscapes,\u201d now on view at New York\u2019s Lehmann Maupin gallery. Opie\u2019s work has often explored genre \u2014 from street photography to formal portraiture \u2014 and these new photographs of the Okefenokee swamps, which straddle the Georgia-Florida state line, are what she jokingly calls \u201camateur National Geographic pictures.\u201d They play with the anthropological dimension of certain landscape photography \u2014 and the language around swamps in our current political culture \u2014 while also calling attention to a disappearing ecosystem. Inside her home, however, as evidenced by the snapshots and captions below, the ecosystem is anything but fragile. When I asked Opie if three months of confinement had changed the dynamics of her family, she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s been lovely, actually. Julie and Oliver are used to it just being the two of them often. They were used to me traveling once or twice a month. But I haven\u2019t been able to get on a plane, or go and give lectures, or go off to my studio much to work. I thought they would get very tired of me. But \u2026 it turns out that they just love me more. They like having me around.\u201dImage\u201cVictoria House Foyer.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cThis is the foyer of my house. There\u2019s a James Welling, there\u2019s a Robert Gober, there\u2019s an Eric Fischl, there\u2019s one of my portraits. It\u2019s just like, as soon as you walk in, you understand that this house is about art, and about family and about life. On the left, in the backward cap, is Jessie, my best friend Bonnie Stoll\u2019s niece. I photographed her when she was just a kid, and it\u2019s always been one of my favorite portraits. I just like living with it. I actually rephotographed her as an adult, but not, obviously, without a shirt. I guess I could have, but I don\u2019t usually do that with bodies. She\u2019s kind of like a family member.\u201dImage\u201cOliver\u2019s Ceramic Sandal.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cThis was one of our son Oliver\u2019s first ceramic pieces that kind of blew us away. He makes ceramics, and he\u2019s really good at it. He made this when he was around 13 years old, I would guess. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve never asked him where the inspiration came from. I have an aunt who\u2019s a sculptor, and she would make pies with women\u2019s bodies coming out of them. We had this sculpture she made specifically for Oliver in our garden when he was little. It was a bronze pterodactyl head coming out of a pie. Oliver has always loved pies \u2014 as a young boy, one of his favorite bedtime stories was a pie recipe book. We would literally read recipes to him. When he was 8 years old, he entered the L.A. Times\u2019s pie-baking contest with a homemade Key lime pie. I think he was the youngest contestant ever.\u201dImage\u201cSunny Sunshine Avoiding.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cOur dog, Sunny, hates having her picture taken. Absolutely hates it. She lives with a photographer, and every time I point a camera at her, she slowly turns her head away. She knows the camera is there \u2014 that\u2019s just her defiance in being photographed. She\u2019s unique in that way. Both Julie and Oliver tolerate me photographing them. But I also haven\u2019t abused them by putting them in lots of work.\u201dImage\u201cChore Boy.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cOn the ledge is a little timer that was given to me by a friend who said that I was the perfect chore boy, alluding to my butchness. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve had for 20 years, always by the kitchen sink. I\u2019m actually pretty handy: I\u2019m good at chores. I like tools. That\u2019s another thing that my family teases me about: \u2018Do you really need that tool?\u2019 \u2018You bought another tool.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, this one is made a little differently and I like the way it looks.\u2019 I took things apart all the time when I was a kid. My grandfather had a really nice 35-millimeter camera, and I just wanted to see how it worked, so I started unscrewing all the screws, sitting at my grandfather\u2019s workbench. And of course, I got in trouble. I didn\u2019t know how to put it back together. I always tell my students: \u2018Make your toolbox large.\u2019 Every kind of piece of equipment you learn will give you more options in how you make work.\u201dImage\u201cFireplace.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cThe shell postcard inside the wave is a piece by the artist Siobhan Liddell. And on the right is a black-and-white portrait of me as a kid \u2014 I must have been 7 there. My favorite piece on the mantel is the sinking ship in a bottle. I found it in a thrift store in Sandusky, Ohio, my hometown, and thought, \u2018How perfect.\u2019 The \u2018Happy Fall\u2019 card, on the left, is a tradition of mine. I kind of get annoyed by all the Christmas cards \u2014 it\u2019s just so many Christmas cards. I mean, it\u2019s nice that everyone says hi and stuff, but I thought, \u2018Well, I love fall.\u2019 Every year since Oliver was born, I\u2019ve taken a portrait of him and sent that out to friends and family in the fall. This year, we\u2019re going to come up to the end of the tradition. He\u2019s 18, and he\u2019s leaving for college. I thought about making a kind of foldout poster of him in his dorm \u2014 you know, like a teen idol? \u2014 and then when you turn the poster over, on the back it will have all the years of all the happy fall cards. That\u2019s what I want to do for the final one.\u201dImage\u201cFlowers.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cJulie grew these flowers in her garden. At the height of Covid, when you weren\u2019t able to buy fresh flowers, she would do these beautiful little arrangements of clippings and put them all over the house. I really loved them \u2014 they felt happy to me in a time that was full of grief.\u201dImage\u201cThe Graduate.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cThat\u2019s Oliver in his graduation gown, leaning his hat down. I was trying to figure out how to make a different kind of portrait of him in his graduation outfit. He didn\u2019t even get to wear it. I mean, he wore it in the house, you know. He\u2019s an awesome kid. When he was 12, he was like, \u2018Mom, my friends are Googling you, and I don\u2019t know what to say to them.\u2019 I said, \u2018Just tell them your mom\u2019s a badass radical dyke artist.\u2019 He responded, \u2018I can\u2019t really say that \u2026\u2019 Anyway, we did a little celebration in the backyard with a cake and his godmoms and his dads and Julie and me and Sara and her son, Joaquin. We watched the graduation on Zoom and put a sign in the front yard.\u201dImage\u201cJoaquin Drawings.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cJoaquin\u2019s my grandson, and he does really amazing drawings. We always put the latest ones on the fridge, because that\u2019s what good grandmas do.

And finally, during Covid, Joaquin was over for the day, and Julie said, \u2018Let\u2019s smear the seeds on Bob Ross and watch it grow.\u2019 I thought it was the perfect thing to take a picture of right now. We love Bob Ross. He\u2019s kind of a joyful pop icon of ours. A year ago, I was teaching at the Atlantic Center for the Arts in Florida. All the artists that stay in the artist-residence apartment there sign their name to the wall. And what name was I looking at but Bob Ross? Bob Ross just follows us around.\u201dImage\u201cBackyard Big Tree.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cThis Aleppo pine is why we bought the house. It\u2019s so tall and magnificent and canopies the entire backyard. I go out and just look up at that tree, and it\u2019s a whole world. I think about everything it holds \u2014 baby squirrel life and birds. It\u2019s got a big, round trunk and these big roots that go down into the ground and bubble back up. People have put patios around it, but then the tree would absorb part of the concrete. One day, somebody put a chain around the tree and that got absorbed, too. It\u2019s just this tree that has seen a lot, and that didn\u2019t get cut down, even though it\u2019s a messy tree. When we saw it we just said, \u2018Oh my God, we need to live with you. You\u2019re an amazing tree.\u2019\u201dImage\u201cHi There.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cThere was a requirement for this story that said there had to be some self-portraits. The focus was so funky on this camera \u2014 I kept trying to take good or interesting self-portraits and it never really worked. And I wasn\u2019t going to have somebody in the family take a picture of me, because I wanted all the pictures to be taken by me. So I thought, \u2018Maybe it will look good if I\u2019m just looking through the door like I\u2019m just surprised to see you and I say, \u2018Hi there.\u2019\u201dImage\u201cFlowers Wilt, Painting Unfinished.\u201dCredit...Courtesy of Catherine Opie\u201cI thought paint by numbers would be a fun thing to do during Covid. But you\u2019re not really painting with this set, you\u2019re just making little teeny gestures of dots of paint. You need a magnifying glass to see these numbers. It is the most obnoxious paint by numbers I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life. I\u2019m trying to finish it, but it\u2019s a little brutal.\u201dImage\u201cMichele + Sunny.

She\u2019s really good at lettering, and then we filled it in together. We take it out of our front yard and with us when we go to protests. I had no idea we could slip back as far as we have under this current administration. I didn\u2019t think that it was possible to see this kind of hate again. But I\u2019m always optimistic, I always have hope, I always have \u2014 the things I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime, including having the right to legally marry Julie, are things that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/t-magazine/jonathan-adler-simon-doonan-home.html", "title": "Inside an Eclectic Retreat on Shelter Island", "summary": "Jonathan Adler and Simon Doonan\u2019s art- and design-filled summer home is a place for both creativity and downtime.", "authors": "By Max Lakin", "text": "Shelter Island, N.Y., a sylvan splash of land positioned between the tines of Long Island\u2019s North and South Forks, is only a 10-minute ferry ride from Sag Harbor and the rest of the Hamptons. And yet, with its weather-beaten clapboard houses and unmanicured lawns \u2014 and its lack of tony bo\u00eetes and traffic lights \u2014 it feels much farther away. The potter and designer Jonathan Adler and the author and fashion commentator Simon Doonan have been visiting the island since they met 25 years ago, and it\u2019s here, on the northern shore, that they built their summer house in 2011.A serene 2,300-square-foot pavilion designed by Gray Organschi Architecture, the house combines the midcentury Southern California Modernism of Richard Neutra with wabi-sabi naturalism: There are contiguous glass walls that wash the rooms in East End light, slate floors the color of the brackish Peconic just a few steps away and natural wood ceiling panels that echo the sand dunes buffeting the property. At first glance, the washed black corrugated steel facade, inspired by the couple\u2019s travels to Japan, might look inscrutable here \u2014 too modern, too brutal \u2014 and yet it seems perfectly at peace among the tall grasses, Japanese black pines and Hollywood junipers that were planted by the local landscape designer Vickie Cardaro and undulate in the breeze coming in from Gardiners Bay to the east.Inside, the property is an effervescent universe filled with a happy, slightly unruly mix of new designs being test-driven for Adler\u2019s furniture and home line, which is known for its kitschy ebullience, alongside pieces contributed by the couple\u2019s friends and thrifting finds that fall just this side of zany. In addition to a Deco sunburst lamp from a thrift shop in Phoenix, Ariz., for instance, visitors will find a giant head-shaped planter by the functional artist Nicola L. and an outsize acrylic foot by Adler that shifts in color like a mood ring. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved art in which ordinary objects are made huge,\u201d he says.ImageThe view of the Peconic from the house. The tall grasses, Japanese black pines and Hollywood junipers were planted by the local landscape designer Vickie Cardaro.Credit...Scott J. RossHe and Doonan worked on the house around the time Adler was commissioned to design the interiors of the Parker Palm Springs hotel, and the home inherited some of that project\u2019s breezy 1950s louche quality in its open floor plan and the fact that it has more seating than would seem strictly necessary (nothing being more luxurious than options). But above all, the space is attuned to the needs and diffuse tastes of its owners, and a sense of free-flowing ease prevails.The main living space alone contains half a dozen studies in scale and texture, including a concrete fire pit, curved steel Warren Platner-designed armchairs and a modular aerated concrete screen for which Adler was inspired by the organic Modernism of Reform synagogues. And the tone is as likely to shift as the references, with the earnest sidling up to the cheeky. In the bedroom, a small \u201970s-era abstraction by the American painter Robert Natkin is in conversation with an etching of George Washington picked up from a thrift store and given a Pop Art-style defacement (which includes an eye patch and a medallion bearing Prince\u2019s love symbol) by Doonan; on the bed is an embroidered suzani textile and, above it, a 1970s Sergio Bustamante brass rhino head sculpture (its giraffe counterpart is installed in the pair\u2019s apartment in the Greenwich Village).Adler\u2019s wide array of handmade vessels runs along a shelf that skims the ceiling like a frieze in what he describes as the \u201cteensy-weensy kitchen,\u201d which is set off from the dining area by a fantastical mural of ospreys, a common sight around the island, as they plunge into the water, by the American artist John-Paul Philippe. (Philippe, a friend whom Doonan, in his former role as the creative director of Barneys New York, conscripted to make Modernist fixtures and murals for the store, is well-represented here; one of his organic abstract steel sculptures stands sentry outside.)Still, about 90 percent of the d\u00e9cor is by Adler. \u201cI\u2019m a very selfish person,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I design something, it\u2019s usually because it\u2019s something I want to live with.\u201d To Doonan, this is only natural: \u201cIt\u2019s suspect to me when you see a designer and they\u2019re not wearing their own stuff. It\u2019s like, hang on, you want everybody else to buy it?\u201d he says. Does he ever tire of living inside Adler\u2019s design process? \u201cPeople always ask us that,\u201d Doonan says. \u201cI think they think of two gay men strangling each other over fabric choices. I\u2019m happy to defer to him in terms of interior design, because that\u2019s his profession. I don\u2019t believe in doing things by committee anyway \u2014 it never works.\u201d Which isn\u2019t to say Doonan is sitting idle. \u201cSimon is unbearably prolific,\u201d Adler says. \u201cHe writes about 85 books a year. He\u2019s like Barbara Cartland.\u201d Currently, Doonan is working on two books: one on Keith Haring, and the other a self-help book titled \u201cHow to Be Yourself,\u201d due out from Phaidon in October.Despite all this industriousness, the house cultivates a sense of freedom, both from the crushing clip of city life and what the writer A.A. Gill called \u201cperfection anxiety,\u201d which Doonan thinks is very much on display back on the mainland. \u201cI\u2019m looking at our backyard, and our oak tree has big, dead branches that look fabulous, and some of the grasses are overgrown into the pathways, but it all looks kind of groovy,\u201d he says. \u201cI think people design houses with resale or presentation in mind, but those things weren\u2019t on our radar. Our neighbors walked in one day and said, \u2018Wow, you\u2019ve made a house for yourselves.\u2019\u201dHe and Adler have, on account of the lockdown, been living in the house full-time since March, the longest stretch they\u2019ve ever stayed there. They watched their cherry blossoms bloom and fade as spring slipped into summer \u2014 the first time, says Adler, that they\u2019ve been present and still enough to fully appreciate the property\u2019s natural charms. They also have a lone fig tree in the entry courtyard. \u201cBecause we\u2019re usually only here a couple days a week, every time we see a fig that\u2019s about to be ripe, by the time we come back, some bird has eaten it,\u201d says Adler. \u201cNow, though, I think we\u2019re finally going to be able to enjoy the figs.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/t-magazine/robert-longo-quarantine-films.html", "title": "The T List: Five Things We Recommend This Week", "summary": "Handblown glass, sparkly shoes, Scottish jewelry \u2014 and more.", "authors": "By Iva Dixit", "text": "Welcome to the T List, a newsletter from the editors of T Magazine.

Both a 54-room hotel and private club by Auberge Resorts, the Commodore was originally built in 1928 by the architect Hal Thompson as the country residence of the Texan businessman Edgar Perry. The Italianate mansion\u2019s original rooms, with picturesque accompanying Juliet balconies, have been transformed by the designer Ken Fulk into signature suites with walls in shades of pink, celadon and sunshine yellow and furnishings in velvet and faux fur. Hand-painted murals by the artist Deborah Phillips are offset by midcentury pieces sourced by Fulk from over two years\u2019 worth of shopping trips to the state\u2019s famous Round Top Antiques Fair. While Perry may have sold the estate in 1944 with the regret that it was \u201ca great place to throw a party but too big to live in,\u201d Fulk\u2019s vision gives the mansion a second life as a place to gather \u2014 perhaps for dinner at the Commodore\u2019s Lutie\u2019s Garden Restaurant, with a menu filled with produce grown nearby \u2014 or merely spend a decadent afternoon strolling the estate, which spans 10 acres and includes a 50-foot swimming pool.

Collection of the Broad Art FoundationBy M.H. MillerI\u2019ve looked at a lot of digital exhibitions from art institutions in the last few months, and my response has almost unanimously been: I wish I could see this in person. One of the more satisfying examples of this kind of presentation \u2014 for me, at least \u2014 is \u201cRobert Longo: Quarantine Films,\u201d on the website of the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow. It functions as both a watch list and a kind of autobiography, interspersing examples of Longo\u2019s work alongside his thoughts on various classics of cinema and how they\u2019ve influenced him. (Longo made one deeply flawed but rather criminally underrated film himself in 1995: \u201cJohnny Mnemonic,\u201d with Keanu Reeves as the star and a screenplay by William Gibson.) Writing about Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1976 film \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d he reminisces about moving to New York and driving a cab to support himself. In a riff about Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cContempt\u201d (1963), which Longo describes as \u201ca film about making a film,\u201d he concludes that \u201csometimes beautiful is all art needs to be.\u201d He even makes a fairly convincing case for 2019\u2019s \u201cJoker\u201d \u2014 a film I walked out of \u2014 as a useful parable about the importance of gun control. Longo is an artist with a style you might call apocalyptic. He makes achingly beautiful paintings out of ugly things, whether a mushroom cloud, a businessman who appears to be falling through the air or a militarized police force, shrouded in tear gas and backlit by the golden arches of a McDonald\u2019s sign. His work is scarily relevant in 2020. \u201cRobert Longo: Quarantine Films\u201d is live now on garagemca.org.Wear ThisFive Playful, Crystal-Embellished SandalsImageClockwise from top left: Justine Clenquet, justineclenquet.com.

Gianvito Rossi, matchesfashion.com.Credit...Courtesy of the brandsBy Gage DaughdrillSandals for summer are no more groundbreaking than florals for spring, and yet donning the right pair can still be an opportunity for self-expression, one that can dress up an ordinary denim skirt or a cotton voile dress. This summer, opt for sandals embellished with crystals to add a sense of decadence. Ren\u00e9 Caovilla has brightened an otherwise ordinary kitten-heeled thong, while By Far has reinvented the mule, laying the over-foot strap with a grid of thinly cut rhinestones. The French jewelry designer Justine Clenquet has joined in with her debut footwear line \u2014 launched this month, in step with her brand\u2019s 10th anniversary \u2014 which features vintage-inspired silhouettes adorned with Swarovski rhinestones and disco-like glitter. For those looking for slightly more subtle options, both Gianvito Rossi and Roger Vivier offer styles that can easily transition from a long walk in the park to an intimate dinner, making stepping around just a little more sparkly and fun.Buy ThisColorful Handblown Glassware for GatheringImageCupples glassware comes in five color options: crystal, amber, slate, aqua and blush.\u00a0Credit...Adam Holtzinger/KeepBy Minju PakIn March, as New York City went into lockdown, the creative community working at UrbanGlass \u2014 a nonprofit organization that provides glassblowing studio space, exhibitions and classes for artists and designers in Downtown Brooklyn \u2014 faced an uncertain future. Glassblowing is impossible to do at home, and since glassblowers work in proximity to one another and often share tools, reopening the studio \u2014 even with social distancing protocols in place \u2014 is a tricky proposition. In a show of hope and resolve, three artists \u2014 Susan Spiranovich and Adam Holtzinger, the founders of the design company Keep, along with Anders Rydstedt \u2014 decided to team up on a project called Re:Gather, the results of which will be made and shipped as soon as the artists are able to return to a studio. Their first product, Cupples, is a series of simple and elegant glasses offered in five colors, including blush, aqua and amber, and features an interlocking design \u2014 a glass band wrapped around half the cups corresponds to an equivalent cutout in the other half \u2014 that illustrates the need for social connection. \u201cWe recognized a shared sense of loss for in-person collaboration that is essential to our work,\u201d says Rydstedt. The name Re:Gather may seem self-explanatory, but it is also a reference to the glassblowing process itself, during which the material is gathered or collected on the end of a blowpipe. Finally, Cupples is meant to remind us of the comforts of sharing a meal with one another, with the hope that we will be able to do so in the near future. $200 for a set of two, keepbrooklyn.com.Covet ThisOne-of-a-Kind Earrings by Grainne MortonImageLeft: a pair of Morton\u2019s Rainbow Ornamental Scroll Balance drop earrings.

The cicadas, according to Morton,\u00a0symbolize personal growth and change.\u00a0Credit...Courtesy of Grainne MortonBy Thessaly La ForceThis is a momentous year for the Irish-born, Scotland-based jeweler Grainne Morton: She\u2019s celebrating her 50th birthday, as well as her 25th anniversary making her fastidiously eclectic jewelry that has found a fan-base of avid collectors around the world. Morton had originally planned to mark her double milestone with a large celebration in a castle just outside of Edinburgh. But the lockdown meant downshifting plans, and in the quiet of the last few months, she and her team have instead been hard at work, making unique pieces of jewelry that feel like the rarest of finds \u2014 10 of which will be released this Friday. \u201cMy parents had an antique shop where they lived in Northern Ireland,\u201d Morton explained to me. \u201cThey would come visit me in Scotland and spend all week trawling the antique shops here. In order to spend time with them, I would come with, and I started collecting.\u201d Morton is fond of mixing mother-of-pearl, moonstones and other gems with found cameos, antique buttons and vintage glass. Everything is made by hand, sometimes taking weeks to complete, as the individual components are first set in silver and then soldered together into playful compositions, often set on a cross or dripping from an anchor piece. As we\u2019re thinking more consciously about who and what we surround ourselves with right now, Morton is creating more than just a beautiful object but a sense of permanence amid the ephemeral world around her.

Those singular displays of fashion art \u2014 handmade clothes custom-ordered by the very few \u2014 represent equal parts creative laboratory, artisanal expertise and visual extravaganza. For many, they are also a major employment opportunity.You may see models in gowns on Instagram, and hear of the famous names responsible for the updos and cat eyes, but making that perfect 20 minutes happen also demands an army of independent contractors, largely unknown. And, now that the shows have gone digital, largely unemployed.Here, a scattering of these men and women describe their lives in the absence of shows. They are but a fraction of the lighting technicians, manicurists, photographers, caterers, florists, drivers, security guards, seamstresses, dressers and musicians whose labor creates the dream.These interviews have been edited.Yesmin O\u2019Brien, 53, hairstylistImage\u201cI\u2019ve worked with the hairstylist Sam McKnight as part of his freelancer team for 13 years. Usually I\u2019m a director for a group of hair salons in and around London, but whenever Sam has been booked for a fashion show, then off I go to that city, be it for cruise, couture or ready-to-wear.There are probably around 40 stylists on Sam\u2019s backstage team at a fashion show. We come from all over the world to work in Paris for couture. Often, for the biggest shows, you work in pairs on one model with a stylist and a \u2018watcher,\u2019 who makes sure the look is absolutely perfect and to the specifications of Sam or the brand.Until you reach the very top, you don\u2019t do it to make money. You do it for career experience with Sam and out of love for the theater of fashion and being a part of it all. It is only after you establish yourself over many years that you make any cash.But for me it has been worth it for the experiences I\u2019ve had. I still pinch myself. We do all the Chanel couture shows, of course, which are always very special. And last July, for the Fendi couture show in Rome that paid tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, we color-coordinated wigs to each of the clothes for the finale, which just looked spectacular. But this year, there is nothing at all.I\u2019ve been trying to use the time to think creatively about possible hair pieces and ideas, but I really miss the atmosphere.\u201dImageFendi haute couture, fall 2019.Credit...Domenico Stinellis/Associated PressJacques Negrit, 56, security guardImage\u201cFashion weeks in Paris make up 60 percent of my annual income, so not having couture this season is a big loss.

I have almost 200 freelance guys working on my books during couture week. Security is hard work \u2014 you\u2019ll be up at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m., securing the set and backstage, planning the entrance and exit strategies for huge crowds in very short spaces of time and often with a number of shows taking place all over town.In what would have been couture, I\u2019ll be thinking about what might happen in terms of physical shows in September. For whatever events take place, security \u2014 and maintenance of new safety regulations \u2014 will be more important than ever before. Whatever happens, we will do what we always do: Get the job done.\u201dLuc Deperrois, 40, florist, St\u00e9phane ChapelleImage\u201cI have worked with St\u00e9phane for 20 years. We are known for our large, extravagant bouquets. We usually work with around 10 to 12 people, although during show time, that usually goes up to 25 to 30.

The fiery, cautionary shade, little seen within living rooms, is characteristic of his work as a whole, which often has an almost defiantly undomestic feel. Emblazoned with amorphous shapes in bold colors that include electric blue, a corrosive chemical green and rust red, his designs don\u2019t immediately evoke a sense of coziness. Only upon closer inspection do the dense, lush textures, subtly uneven surfaces and satisfying thickness of the pieces reveal themselves, encouraging a childlike impulse to sprawl across them.It\u2019s this contrast between abstraction and tactility, aesthetics and utility, that Atton Moore, 24, explores in his work. \u201cI love things with a use,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, fine art has a slight disconnect: It\u2019s beautiful, but I always want something more.\u201d For the past few months he has been hunkered down in the cool, quiet basement of his mother and stepfather\u2019s house in rural Kent, making rugs for his debut solo show. Organized by the design dealer Jermaine Gallacher and scheduled to open in his South London showroom in October, the exhibition will comprise eight or so rugs of varying sizes and will expose Atton Moore\u2019s work, until now known mostly to a handful of his fellow London creatives and those who have come across his Instagram account, to its widest audience yet.Atton Moore only began tufting \u2014 as the practice of making a rug by inserting threads through a woven backing fabric using a specially made gun is known \u2014 a little under two years ago. He had recently graduated from the London College of Communication with a degree in illustration and was searching for a new outlet. Though he had some experience with loom weaving, he was eager to work on a more ambitious scale, and tufting offered a practical way to make larger textile pieces (his rugs currently range from roughly 4-by-6 feet to 5-by-7 feet). After cobbling together a wooden rug-making frame at his then home in London and watching video tutorials on YouTube, he honed his skills through trial and error. Tufting, which is solitary and slow-paced, he found, was a welcome contrast to his other career, in modeling, which he had fallen into several years before; modeling, meanwhile, helps fund his rug-making practice, and fashion designs have occasionally provided ideas for a shape here or a color there.ImageUsing an electric tufting gun, Atton Moore works on one of a series of rugs with motifs based on magnolia tree petals.Credit...Benjamin McMahonFor the most part, though, Atton Moore\u2019s inspirations spring from more unexpected places, and derive either from an exploration of a specific form or an attempt to document the anxieties of contemporary life reflected back to us through our screens. One sprawling rug of white, burgundy and maroon \u2014\u00a0part of an ongoing series he calls \u201cStudies of Leon\u201d \u2014 features abstracted renderings of elbows and moles based on nude photographs he took of a friend and then distorted almost beyond recognition. Another depicts an aerial view of water pooled in various patterns on top of one of many expanses of radioactive topsoil that have been stored under vast plastic sheets in Fukushima, Japan, since the 2011 nuclear disaster there. The image is taken from the 2018 documentary series \u201cDark Tourist,\u201d about the niche travel-industry sector that arranges access to macabre places; Atton Moore took a screen grab of this scene and recreated the water patterns with nebulous black and white splotches about the size of a hand on a clay-colored background. In fact, he frequently creates motifs from screenshots of images he has taken, often zooming in on a particular person or environment to capture their exact look at a specific moment in time. \u201cRugs and tapestries tell stories you can look back on in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to document the world now.\u201dImageTo begin a new rug, Atton Moore projects a sketch onto a piece of woven backing fabric, though he often makes changes to the image as he works.Credit...Benjamin McMahonImageDetails of four of his rugs, clockwise from left: an as yet unnamed green work from 2020; \u201cOphelia\u201d (2019); \u201cI Don\u2019t Know What Day It Is Anymore\u201d (2020); \u201cIt Hailed Today\u201d (2020).Credit...Benjamin McMahonHis latest rug, which depicts in close-up the shapes of fallen petals from a magnolia tree in the verdant garden of the house in Kent, is an oblique portrait of the effects of climate change. \u201cThe petals fell so early this year,\u201d he says, gesturing toward the tree, when I visit in May. \u201cI started collecting them at different stages and photocopying them together.\u201d Dozens of black-and-white images of different petals lie in a pile in his work space, their forms resembling beguiling Rorschach tests. Hanging across the back wall, the rug, still a work in progress, evokes a topographical map, the decaying bits of petal like black tributaries against a forest-green background. As he does with all his pieces, he first used a projector to transfer a sketch onto a gray polyester backing fabric to create a guide before running the tufting gun in close lines up and down the cloth, a time- and labor-intensive process whose repetitiveness he finds soothing. Once the tufting is finished, he will then seal the underside, hand-stitch the edges with a needle and finally crop the yarn to a more regular length \u2014 though not so uniform as to lose all its natural undulation. For this last stage, he uses one of his most prized tools: a pair of sheepshearing clippers. It will take him about two weeks, from start to finish, to complete the piece \u2014 and between 40 and 50 spools of vintage dead-stock yarn.ImageAtton Moore\u2019s inspirations range widely, from the natural world to photographs of friends to his own visions of a dystopian future.Credit...Benjamin McMahonImageRed yarn, which the artist favors for its bold, attention-grabbing quality, features prominently in many of his designs.Credit...Benjamin McMahonIndeed, if Atton Moore\u2019s motifs are often mediated through a screen, his approach is otherwise decidedly analog and traditional. While a number of artists \u2014 from Alexander Calder to Deborah Kass \u2014 have created rugs stitched with their images, they have tended to rely on other makers to produce them. For Atton Moore, having his own hands in every stage of the process is essential: By allowing the edges of a piece to be slightly wonky, or the pile of another subtly uneven, he is leaving his mark. Lifting a corner of one of his rugs reveals the stitching still visible underneath: He purposefully seals each creation with clear latex, he says, \u201cso you can see it\u2019s not perfectly done, that someone made it.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/t-magazine/facials-at-home.html", "title": "Four Restorative Facials to Try at Home", "summary": "The products, tools and tips from the professionals that you need to be your own facialist.", "authors": "By Kari Molvar", "text": "The New York-based aesthetician Isabelle Bellis, who is accustomed to using her hands for much of the day \u2014 lifting, sculpting and massaging the facial muscles of her clients \u2014 has felt a noticeable loss lately. Since deciding to permanently close her Manhattan studio after the pandemic hit, Bellis has turned to gardening, at her home in rural Connecticut, as a way to keep her fingers nimble and active \u2014 and, she says, to \u201cfill the void.\u201dBut to lend support to her regulars, who miss her healing touch, and to anyone else looking to clear pores, de-puff under-eye bags and calm inflammation, she and many other facialists who are physically distant from their clients have also been dispensing at-home care tips. The Los Angeles-based aesthetician Joomee Song, for example, has been fielding emails and sending out curated care packages of skin products while Elaine Ng Huntzinger has teleconferenced with clients to offer pointers on gua sha \u2014 the ancient Chinese facial toning practice \u2014 from her Paris apartment. Much can be done remotely, the experts say: Masks and creams can impart treatment-like benefits and high-tech tools can substitute, when necessary, for a professional\u2019s deft hands. Here, four quick but effective facials to incorporate into your routine, to brighten, lift and revitalize your complexion.Brightening and SmoothingWhile exfoliating gently each day, or even once a week, can work wonders, sometimes a deeper cleanse is called for \u2014 especially in summer, when sweat and sunscreen can lead to buildup and a dull, uneven complexion. For a facial that will counteract this effect, Song recommends beginning by lightly sweeping a gauze pad saturated in a pore-refining toner, such as Circumference\u2019s Active Botanical Refining Toner, $60, over the face. For a more powerful remedy, buff with a dermaplaning tool \u2014 Dermaflash\u2019s One, $139, has a vibrating edge that lightly removes the top layer of skin. Then, apply a potent brightening serum, such as Klur\u2019s Brilliant Light, $80, which contains ferulic acid and vitamins C and E, ingredients that work in harmony to reduce dark spots. To speed absorption when applying any serum, Huntzinger recommends rubbing it between your fingers for a few seconds, then tapping it into your skin. \u201cNext, I make fast, brush-like motions from my jawline to my cheekbones,\u201d she says. \u201cWith my fingers, I lightly pat around my eyes, and finish by pressing my face with my whole hand, making sure the serum has fully penetrated.\u201d Finally, slather on a moisturizer with sunscreen to prevent any discoloration from returning.Hydrating and HealingFacialists typically rely on multiple products \u2014 including mists, essences and concentrates \u2014 to give skin a fresh, plumped appearance. If you don\u2019t have the patience (or budget) for quite so many layers but want to achieve a dewy look, start by finding a single, high-quality serum that contains hyaluronic acid \u2014 a humectant that pulls in moisture like a sponge. Bynacht\u2019s Hypercharged Glass Skin Serum, $320, is made with a blend of eight hyaluronic acids \u2014 of varying molecular weights \u2014 to ensure it reaches the skin\u2019s deepest layers (a more affordable option is L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019s 1.9% Pure Hyaluronic Acid 7 Replumping Ampoules, $25). Apply the serum with a gentle touch \u2014 starting at the center of the face and then moving out to the sides and up to the temples \u2014 for a relaxing massage, says Song. Follow with a creamy mask, such as Epara\u2019s Intense Hydrating Mask, \u00a3105 (about $133), or a sheet mask: 111Skin\u2019s Y Theorem Bio Cellulose Facial Mask, $32, delivers softening amino acids into the skin via a bio-cellulose film.Calming and SculptingManual lymphatic drainage massage helps remove excess fluid (lymph) in the body with carefully choreographed motions that can be difficult for a novice to master at home. A more accessible technique is gua sha, says Huntzinger, which involves gliding a stone tool (she likes the versions by Lanshin) over your face to boost circulation and release muscle tension. Start by applying a mist, oil or serum so the stone has some slip (try Rose Ingleton MD\u2019s Skin Calming Booster, $70). Position the notched edge of the tool at the center of your chin, keeping the stone flat against the skin. Lightly drag the stone along your jawline, moving it up to your right ear. Repeat this five times, then do the same on the other side of your jaw, moving the stone up to your left ear. Continue this process by working in zones: across the cheeks, under the eyes, and forehead, always beginning in the center of the face, and moving upward to the sides. Another option, says the Dallas-based facialist Joanna Czech, is a toning microcurrent device, such as the NuFace Trinity, $325, which zaps muscles with (mostly painless) pulsating electrical currents for a noticeable lift. Follow with a toning serum \u2014 Czech swears by Biologique Recherche\u2019s Serum VG Tensil, $72 \u2014 and a firming cream, such as Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Revitalizing Supreme+ Global Anti-Aging Cell Power Cr\u00e8me, $87.Decongesting and ClarifyingNow that many of us are homebound, Bellis says, there\u2019s an opportunity to \u201cliberate one\u2019s skin from the pore-clogging effects of daily makeup.\u201d To further clear the complexion, Bellis recommends beginning with a double cleanse: Lather on an emollient balm to dissolve debris, then an alpha-hydroxy wash to eliminate excess oil (try Holifrog\u2019s Kissimmee Vitamin F Therapy Balmy Wash, $42, and Shasta AHA Refining Acid Wash, $38). From there, minimize acne-causing bacteria with a blue-light therapy device \u2014 Huntzinger is a fan of Foreo\u2019s Espada, $134 \u2014 or consider a pore-refining clay mask, such as Aesop\u2019s Chamomile Concentrate Anti-Blemish Masque, $45, followed by a non-greasy moisturizer (try Shani Darden\u2019s Weightless Oil-Free Moisturizer, $48). Bellis likes to finish by applying a cold compress made from a chilled herbal tea blend of calendula, chamomile, rose hips and fresh mint, which, she says, contains antihistamines that reduce swelling. \u201cAnd make enough so you have a cup to drink,\u201d she adds: a facial should be relaxing whether the setting is a spa or your living room \u2014 and hydrating will only give your skin an added boost."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/t-magazine/nick-cave-bob-faust-amends.html", "title": "A Public Art Project Devoted to Dismantling Racism at Every Level", "summary": "With \u201cAmends,\u201d the artists Nick Cave and Bob Faust have created a multipronged platform for self-scrutiny and, they hope, lasting change.", "authors": "By Megan O\u2019Grady", "text": "It\u2019s Juneteenth and at Facility, Bob Faust and Nick Cave\u2019s art lab and studio space in Chicago, the installation of the first component of their latest community-based project, \u201cAmends,\u201d is underway.

Most of all, there are acknowledgments of vast unearned, unquestioned privilege and commitments to do better.ImageA detail of \u201cLetters to the World Toward the Eradication of Racism\u201d that includes a line from Cave: \u201cIf U Want to March About It, U Have to Talk About It.\u201dCredit...James Prinz\u201cGeorge Floyd was another tipping point for me,\u201d says Cave, for whom the beating of Rodney King nearly three decades ago was a watershed moment in his career, leading him to create his Soundsuits, ornate, full-body assemblages designed to rattle and resonate with their wearer. In a profile of the artist last fall, I described them as a \u201ckind of race-, class- and gender-obscuring armature, one that\u2019s both insulating and isolating, an articulation of his profound sense of vulnerability as a Black man.\u201d This year, the killing of Floyd, along with the fatal shootings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, among others, have led all of us to wonder how much, if anything, has changed. \u201cIt made me question my own practice,\u201d Cave says. \u201cIs my work purposeful enough? Why does this keep happening? How can I do more? I\u2019ve been working against this problem and for this issue my entire career and am more committed to it than ever. We all need to be talking about it. \u2018Amends\u2019 is one way I can ask all to contribute and to keep the conversations and momentum of right now.\u201dWe have seen things we can never unsee; the frustration and fury that have compelled Americans to take to the streets in protest have led to reckonings at all levels and in all forms. We are, as a culture, in a process of self-scrutiny. For some, this means volunteering for progressive political candidates or raising awareness of any number of entrenched racist structures, including a for-profit carceral system, defunded public schools and gerrymandered voting districts. For others, it means taking the time to explain the history of redlining to our kids or committing to diverse hiring practices. Cave and Faust, his partner in work and life, not only want these reckonings to continue, they want them to go deeper. And for white Americans who are still asking, \u201cWhere do I even begin?\u201d their answer is: Take a look in the mirror.ImageA detail of \u201cLetters to the World Toward the Eradication of Racism.\u201dCredit...James PrinzA mixed-race couple (Cave is Black, Faust is white) whose collaborations have long sought to bring people together to address social concerns, the artists have never flinched from leading tough conversations about race and responsibility; their work showcases the potential power of community-engaged art in a highly individualistic, capitalist society. As Faust explains it, the origins of \u201cAmends\u201d came out of a talk they had after he returned from a march with his teenage daughter. Cave said to them, \u201cIf you want to march about it, you have to talk about it,\u201d words that are now displayed prominently on the gallery windows.Public art has already been powerfully felt as of late. From the spectacular murals of Floyd that have cropped up in cities across the country to the artist Jammie Holmes\u2019s use of airplane banners bearing Floyd\u2019s last words, and from screenings of Arthur Jafa\u2019s landmark film \u201cLove Is the Message, the Message Is Death\u201d (2016) to the celebrations of Black creativity flooding social media, the importance of art in our current civil rights movement is unquestionable. But how can Black artists, inevitably tasked with putting words and images to American brutality and injustice, reposition the burden to end racism by placing it where it should be \u2014 on white individuals? How to convert empathy to action, or frustration, righteousness and grief into something enduring?ImageThe artist and Cave Studio assistant Nathan Hoyle contributing to the work.Credit...Bob FaustImageErin Diamond of the local nonprofit Uncharted transcribing a letter from Vicki Heyman, the co-founder of Uncharted and the co-author of \u201cThe Art of Diplomacy\u201d (2019).Credit...Bob Faust\u201cWe\u2019re asking people to be vulnerable, and that\u2019s a big ask,\u201d says Faust. \u201cTo actually confront yourself, and then have to write it, and rewrite it, and rewrite it until it gets to a point that you\u2019re actually raw and not just writing what you think you\u2019re supposed to say.\u201d Making amends won\u2019t end with this project or in November, with the election, he points out; it is an ongoing process of rectifying wrongs. \u201cHopefully, with the commitment of real feelings to these things in a public way, we can take some of that anxiety away from an individual to do it. Because I think that\u2019s what we all need to know \u2014 that we\u2019re all guilty.\u201dDuring the second phase of the project, \u201cAmends: Community Clothesline,\u201d which begins next Thursday, anyone can stop by and write on yellow ribbons and tie them to a clothesline on the schoolyard across the street in a show of solidarity and commitment to change. But it\u2019s perhaps the project\u2019s final component, which asks for global participation in the form of a hashtag, #AMENDS, that is the most ambitious. \u201cIt is not a call out, but rather a call to action through acknowledgment and subsequent change in each of us,\u201d the artists explain on their website. Everyone is invited to use the hashtag to acknowledge their own role in the common project. Taking responsibility, Cave and Faust remind us, isn\u2019t just a matter of public performance but a necessary step in order for hearts and minds to move toward reconciliation. \u201cAt least for me,\u201d explains Faust, \u201cthe moment you write something down it takes a different position in the body.

France chronicled ACT UP and other groups that demanded more expansive medical research during the escalating AIDS crisis of the \u201980s and \u201990s, first for alternative queer publications and later for mainstream ones including Newsweek and New York magazine, before moving into filmmaking in 2012 with \u201cHow to Survive a Plague,\u201d his account, told using archival footage, of the protest-led battle against H.I.V. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in studying the people who are able to step up and launch transformative activism from the outside,\u201d he says.His latest film, \u201cWelcome to Chechnya,\u201d premiering June 30 on HBO, builds on this theme. It follows an underground group of activists who risk their lives to provide sanctuary and safe passage for L.G.B.T.Q. citizens of the Russian republic, where gay people are routinely tortured and killed as part of a campaign to supposedly cleanse the nation\u2019s bloodline \u2014 violence that the government has largely shrugged off. It\u2019s the conclusion to what France considers his trilogy, starting with \u201cHow to Survive a Plague,\u201d which was nominated for the Academy Award for best documentary, and his 2017 film \u201cThe Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,\u201d about the mysterious passing of the prominent black trans activist.\u201cWelcome to Chechnya\u201d uses a version of deepfake technology to disguise the faces and voices of France\u2019s subjects in order to preserve both their anonymity and humanity \u2014 a technique he developed after workshopping various ideas (including a Snapchat-like filter) and asking multiple Hollywood visual-effects experts for advice. The digital process, a first of its kind, allows us to empathize with the protagonists \u2014 all of whom are running away from the stability of family and home toward safety and the unknown \u2014 while keeping their identities shrouded. \u201cThere\u2019s a very specific ask of the audience,\u201d France says. \u201cWitness this. Don\u2019t let Putin and [the Chechnyan leader Ramzan] Kadyrov get away with this. There are still 70 countries around the world where it\u2019s illegal to be gay, and eight where being so is punishable by death.\u201d (In the film\u2019s chilling final moments, France notes that the Trump administration has refused these L.G.B.T.Q. Chechnyan refugees entry to America.)France, who is currently at work on a film about the novel coronavirus, shared with T his five essential documentaries, all of which deal with humanity in its most harrowing and transcendent extremes.\u2018The Cave\u2019 (2019)\u201cThe Syrian filmmaker Feras Fayyad is one of the most soulful documentary filmmakers working today,\u201d says France about the director of this movie, which profiles a female doctor, Amani Ballour, working in dire conditions throughout the Syrian civil war in a makeshift medical facility that gives the film its name. \u201cIt\u2019s shot inside an underground hospital targeted by Russian airstrikes, and Fayyad finds generosity, love and beauty where it is least expected,\u201d he says.\u20185 Broken Cameras\u2019 (2012)\u201cEmad Burnat is a West Bank farmer who bought a camera to capture his growing family, but his gaze turned outward when Israelis destroyed his olive trees to make room for a barrier wall,\u201d France says. The resulting film documents the ensuing protests, reflecting upon how the personal and political collide and giving a human face to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cFive times his cameras were shot or smashed, but the documentary evidence nonetheless survived.\u201d\u2018The Work\u2019 (2017)\u201cThis film was shot inside Folsom Prison, but that\u2019s not its point,\u201d says France. \u201cIt\u2019s about the very hard work we all need to undertake if we hope to reconcile with our past, and with the difficult truths of the world we inherited.\u201d In following the San Francisco-based nonprofit group Inside Circle, which provides therapy-like sessions to inmates \u2014 the titular \u201cwork\u201d \u2014 this searing study, directed by Jairus McLeary, shows how the prison system can look beyond punishment toward the true roots of criminal activity. \u201cIt\u2019s about how to find a way, together, to create a better future,\u201d France adds.\u2018Freedom on My Mind\u2019 (1994)As voters\u2019 rights are set to become even more of a flashpoint during this year\u2019s elections, this documentary, directed by Marilyn Mulford and Connie Field, about the 1964 push to sign up black voters in Mississippi \u2014 during what was known as Freedom Summer \u2014 feels newly relevant. \u201cWe should all go back and watch this Oscar-nominated film about the brutal voter registration campaign in Mississippi and the dogged activists who weathered that war,\u201d France says. \u201cThese are the shoulders we stand on as we take on the unfinished work of racial justice in America.\u201d\u2018Honeyland\u2019 (2019)\u201cThere is no more beautiful film about the need for finding harmony with the natural world,\u201d France says of this 2019 Academy Award contender, which doubles as a fable of sorts. Directed by Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov, it tells the story of a Macedonian beekeeper, Hatidze Muratova, focusing on the ways her routine \u2014 and nature\u2019s delicate balance \u2014 is upended when new neighbors descend. \u201cStunningly shot in isolated North Macedonia,\u201d says France, \u201cit chronicles one woman who lives a life fit for a long-ago era when the disaster of the modern world arrives.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/t-magazine/linda-goode-bryant-senga-nengudi.html", "title": "The Gallery Where Stevie Wonder Was a Regular", "summary": "", "authors": "", "text": "This summer, Linda Goode Bryant, the pioneering art dealer, received the 2020 Berresford Prize from the nonprofit United States Artists, which is awarded annually to \u201ca cultural practitioner who has contributed significantly to the advancement, well-being and care of artists in society.\u201d In 1974 Bryant founded the gallery Just Above Midtown on 57th Street, which became one of New York City\u2019s first dedicated art spaces for Black artists.

From the beginning, there was so much conversation.LGB: There was so much conversation. I actually believe that you belong to a tribe. And that often weaves itself in life.SN: Absolutely.LGB: There\u2019s the birth family. But then, that family that you discover through life is just your tribe. I\u2019m never surprised by those connections.SN: We were talking the other day about how to describe your role working with artists and we talked about the \u201cartful conductor.\u201d That you have all of these instruments and you\u2019re at the command center utilizing everybody in the best way possible, so they can be seen in their brilliance. And you are the one in the center, the ultimate brilliant one allowing all of this light around you. And allowing everyone to do their best, not only for themselves but for others.

It\u2019s just one big stew. And occasionally, the carrots are kicking. And the tomatoes are going: \u201cHey. Wait a minute. I got this idea.\u201d And the next thing you know, all this stuff is simmered together. And the stew itself is the most nutritional meal you could have. All this creativity and imagination and the different ways we can make things and do things and share things that bring us closer together in our own relationships with one another.The making of art is uniquely human, and it enhances who we are and how we relate to one another. It makes us more empathetic and understanding of the world around us. It helps us relate to people who we don\u2019t see as similar to ourselves.

Art feeds. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so many people expressing themselves during this time, because art is nourishing. It\u2019s centering. I like to say one plus one equals three.

And I called up Romare and I said: \u201cRomie, Romie! I got a lease! I got a lease! Can I come down? Can I show you? Can I show you?\u201d And I ran up all those stairs on Canal Street. He was on the top floor, as I recall. Five flights. And he opened the door with that cat in his arms and said: \u201cTake a breath. Sit down.\u201d He looked at the lease and said, \u201cYou\u2019re really going to do this thing.\u201dAnd he said something to me that it took me until my 50s to hear. And it was in my 60s that I actually ingested it. And I think now, at 70, I\u2019m just now able to process it within my being. And what he said to me was: \u201cLinda, this is what I want you to know. Don\u2019t worry if people love you. All you want them to do is respect you. You don\u2019t want love because love is fickle. Respect is forever. It\u2019s enduring.\u201dSN: Wow, yeah.ImageLinda Goode Bryant and Senga Nengudi with friends at Just Above Midtown gallery.Credit...Courtesy of Senga NengudiImageBryant and Nengudi at Just Above Midtown gallery.Credit...Courtesy of Senga NengudiLGB: And I couldn\u2019t hear him. I was like: \u201cWhy is he popping my balloon? I have the lease. I run up all these stairs. I fly from 57th Street to Canal Street on the subway. Are you kidding me? You\u2019re popping my bubble here.\u201d At the time, I really couldn\u2019t hear that. And then, as life progressed, I\u2019m just now embracing the notion of respect because I\u2019ve never really \u2014 I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing because I really believe in what I\u2019m doing.Art can be anything. I think all of us are artists. And some of us choose to pursue it as a focus of our life because we have nothing. We can\u2019t do anything else. It\u2019s the compulsion of what we do.SN: Yes.LGB: JAM was a family. It was a family that manifests. It was the stew that manifests as a family. We were definitely family.SN: Who else did you work with?LGB: Someone had a contact for Roberta Flack in the early days of JAM and she was collecting this artist in Jamaica, Kapo. Eventually that led to her underwriting a show of Kapo\u2019s work at JAM. That experience introduced me to everybody that was in the music world at that time.SN: How did they find you?LGB: The gallery was well positioned because right next door to us on that fifth floor at 50 West 57th Street was an Italian tailor named Mario. All the basketball stars who were Mario\u2019s clients would come into the gallery when they went to see Mario. Miles Davis recorded in that building and he went to Mario too. And then we got all this press talking about this Black gallery on 57th Street that the art world couldn\u2019t understand. So then other people start finding us.Stevie Wonder would come into the gallery when he was in New York City and we would just talk and have great conversations with one another back then.SN: Wow.LGB: And he bought art even though he couldn\u2019t see it. He bought a wonderful David Hammons piece.SN: Did you describe it to him?LGB: No, he touched it. He felt it.ImageSenga Nengudi performing \u201cAir Propo\u201d at Just Above Midtown gallery in New York, 1981.Credit...Courtesy of Linda Goode Bryant, Senga Nengudi and L\u00e9vy Gorvy gallerySN: I was thinking back to when you were saying that Romare Bearden was telling you how determined you were. I like to call you the Determinator. That is your title. There has been this line throughout everything you do. You see a void that needs to be filled. Whether it\u2019s addressing gentrification in Ohio with your filmmaking or Project EATS when you saw that there was a huge problem in the community related to not only getting food to people but having nourishing education. I think the line started with JAM and has been throughout everything you\u2019ve done since then.LGB: If we go back to the stew metaphor, I think one of the wonderful things about JAM was that we all had that seasoning, being together, and that strengthened it.SN: Mm-hmm.LGB: And so it was in collaboration. It was us together. That strengthened my determination as I\u2019m sure it strengthened the determination of all others, is what I\u2019m trying to say. There was something about what we created in that space, who we were and how that manifested in that space, that made that space possible. It was all about the way that we supported and cared for one another, even when we disagreed.SN: I think that you\u2019re not giving yourself enough credit.LGB: Probably not. I really like to be quiet.SN: I still think you are the conductor, the glue, or something like that. You are the artful conductor because you have a number of skill sets that are helpful. I am an artist. I do what I do. But you also have the skill of business. In fact, you created those workshops at JAM \u2014 The Business of Being an Artist. That side of it was woefully lacking for many of us artists.ImageLinda Goode Bryant on the set of \u201cFlag Wars,\u201d her 2003 film with Laura Poitras.Credit...Courtesy of Linda Goode BryantLGB: I went and got a business degree because a man who had ties to potential patrons told me that he thought it was ludicrous I started a gallery. Some curators told me that too. Anyway, one day this man came into the gallery and said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to last. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. What do you know about balance sheets and financial statements?\u201d And blah, blah, blah. So I said: \u201cYou need to get out of here. I mean I can\u2019t believe you would come in here, and tell me what I don\u2019t know.\u201d But it stayed with me. And it made me realize business is mother wit. They want to fancy it up, put a degree behind it, and charge a lot of money for that degree. That\u2019s well and good for them but the fact of the matter is business is common sense. So I guess, I will always hold dear to the belief that the essential quality of all life, no matter what form it takes, from amoeba to animal to human beings and beyond, is the ability to use what you have to create what you need.SN: That\u2019s your theme song.LGB: I have an M.B.A. but that\u2019s technical stuff and not the essence of trying to run a business. So for me, what has kept me going, even in the moments when I felt I was alone in what I was trying to do, has been family. That family that was JAM created the foundation of the families that have come since JAM. And it\u2019s difficult now to create that. Not just because of Covid, but also because of modernization. Science and technology, as with everything else, has its pluses and minuses. I think the minuses of so much of digital technology, and the way we connect, and the way we perceive ourselves as community can pull us very far apart, despite its intentions to bring us together. And so, I\u2019m really grateful for family.SN: I think I need to add another element of who Linda is, which is ever enthusiastic, ever curious.LGB: Oh yeah.SN: Ever in a state of \u201cwhat if?\u201dLGB: That\u2019s true.SN: And it serves as a magnet to other people who want to join the band, so to speak. It convinces them that certain things can be done. That they have a place in what\u2019s going on. They can dream with you for this higher vision.LGB: When those dreams are there, you can actually make it tangible. It doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re going to be successful by any number of definitions of success. To me, the success is that you pursue it. Just go for it and let\u2019s see."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/t-magazine/queer-bipoc-artists.html", "title": "Works for the Now, by Queer Artists of Color", "summary": "Pride Month may have come to a close, but the wide-ranging pieces shown here have staying power.", "authors": "", "text": "As the country contends with ongoing violence against queer and BIPOC communities, it\u2019s paramount that voices from those communities are heard.

Photo: Natalia MantiniBy rafa esparza, 38, based in Los Angeles\u201cbust: indestructible columns\u201d drew on an earlier performance I did in 2015, for which I ensconced myself in a concrete pillar outside of the Men\u2019s Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles and, once the concrete had dried, freed myself using a hand-chisel and a hammer. The work was a comment on police violence and the sort of surveillance endured by black and brown bodies. I intentionally did it in a public place, where I might have an encounter with the police and where people could bear witness and be more than a passive audience. Last year, I, along with Performance Space and Ballroom Marfa and a number of individual collaborators, brought a version of the piece to the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. In this case, I was thinking about the racist rhetoric of this administration, and the column was a replica of one of those lining the porticoes at the White House. Afterward, there was a dinner with a feast prepared by Gerardo Gonzalez and readings of writers\u2019 reflections on the day. The evening evolved into a dance party and was a reminder of, given the risks and laboriousness of creating culture and speaking truth to power as queer folks, how important it is for us to have spaces dedicated to care and joy. Later this week, a new project that I organized with the artist Cassils will launch \u2014 I can\u2019t say too much, but it involves 80 different artists from all walks of life coming together to appeal for the abolishment of immigrant detention.ImageA detail of Shen Wei\u2019s \u201cSelf-portrait (Mochi)\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Flowers Gallery, London, New York, Hong KongImageA detail of Wei\u2019s \u201cSelf-portrait (Origami)\u201d (2019) .Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Flowers Gallery, London, New York, Hong KongBy Shen Wei, 43, based in New YorkRecently, I completed my decade-long self-portrait series \u201cI Miss You Already,\u201d many of the images from which were photographed during my extensive travels around the world; the series was a diary and a travelogue for capturing meaningful moments. One of the first things I do when I walk into any hotel or guest room is set up my camera on a tripod. That way, when the moment is right, the camera is there and ready, though often it stands there the entire trip without me taking a single picture. \u201cSelf-portrait (Mochi)\u201d (2019) was photographed in a friend\u2019s apartment in Paris. When I\u2019m abroad, I must always stop by an Asian grocery store to satisfy my longing for homey food. I\u2019m from Shanghai, where sticky rice is a staple, and felt very nostalgic eating a piece of mochi cake by a Parisian window shadowed with painterly bamboo leaves. \u201cSelf-portrait (Origami)\u201d (2019) was photographed in Puebla, Mexico, in the morning hour at the dining table in my hotel room. Whenever I see paper napkins, my natural reaction is to fold them origami style, an art form I grew up learning. Something about doing a familiar thing in a foreign environment comforts me. At the end of the shoot, I folded a fan, a swan and an elephant. It was a perfectly introverted moment \u2014 I was alone but not lonely.ImageSable Elyse Smith\u2019s \u201cRiot I\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist, JTT, New York, and Carlos/Ishikawa, LondonBy Sable Elyse Smith, 33, based in New York\u201cRiot I\u201d (2019) is from an ongoing series of sculptures, and that fact is important \u2014 the series is as much the work as any of the individual pieces within it. We are dealing in \u2014\u00a0we are trafficking in \u2014 systems here. The initial impetus for this series was the site of the prison visiting room, and the works themselves are altered one-to-one scale replicas of the furniture within those rooms. This is about touch and its foreclosure, intimacy and its foreclosure, as well as performance and commodification and exploitation. It\u2019s about economics both micro and macro \u2014 defund the [expletive] police. Basically, these structures are emblematic of a system and infrastructure, a labor and actual people, actual lives. The bodies of \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cunfree\u201d are meant to be affixed to this furniture for the duration of a visit. And there is so, so, so much more I could say about all of this. Maybe \u201cRiot I\u201d is an epic poem.ImageJonathan Lyndon Chase\u2019s \u201cwarm seat\u201d (2019).\u00a0Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Company Gallery, New YorkBy Jonathan Lyndon Chase, 30, based in PhiladelphiaThis work is based on memories shared with my husband, William. We were cleaning out the closet, going through mostly clothes and shoe boxes. It was cold that winter and our hearts and minds were cluttered with different emotions caused by the outside world that had come into the interior of our home and bodily homes. Our bedroom was like an icebox, but having our bodies close together kept us warm as we unpacked that evening. I wrote the following poem to accompany the image:Kiss some friction on my rubber bandSweet burning lickHis nails crush through and through wavesWhy does his forehead feel like an icy wet dinner plateImageDevan Shimoyama\u2019s \u201cGrandmother\u2019s Blessing\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artistImageShimoyama\u2019s \u201cThe Abduction of Ganymede\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artistBy Devan Shimoyama, 30, based in PittsburghI tend to use unconventional materials, specifically in my paintings, and often borrow from drag culture and the glamorous black women I\u2019ve known. I\u2019m thinking about the spaces where we celebrate identity and construct different fantasies on top of our bodies \u2014 there\u2019s a sort of peacocking associated with wearing one\u2019s Sunday best, for instance. \u201cGrandmother\u2019s Blessing\u201d (2019) shows my own grandmother, with pieces of costume jewelry affixed to the canvas for her eyes and a blouse made of a beaded brocade. Whenever I move into a new place, she makes a point of coming out to visit and bless it, which sort of completes the space for us both. \u201cThe Abduction of Ganymede\u201d leans more toward fantasy, a driving force in my work that allows me to create a brighter alternate reality. In the Greek myth, Zeus either sends his eagle or turns into an eagle and then abducts the most beautiful boy. My take is about self-love, about being able to embrace the narrative that you, with your black body, are beautiful.ImageChristina Quarles\u2019s \u201cOh Dear, Look Whut We\u2019ve Dun to tha Blues\u201d (2020).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, LondonImageQuarles\u2019s \u201cPull on Thru tha Nite\u201d (2017).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Pilar Corrias Gallery, LondonBy Christina Quarles, 35, based in Los Angeles\u201cOh Dear, Look Whut We\u2019ve Dun to tha Blues\u201d (2020) was one of the last paintings I made before the United States entered quarantine. I was feeling rising anxiety all around me, this sense that we were all going through the motions of business as usual amid a spreading virus. This doom bubbling just below the veneer of a calm, often decadent facade is one I have also felt with regard to the urgency of issues like global warming, racial injustice and class inequality, to name a few. Perhaps this is what led to me painting one of the figures with a pattern that I see as oscillating between expensive pink marble terrazzo and a stinky cheap slice of pimento loaf. \u201cPull on Thru tha Nite\u201d (2017) is titled for the visual pun of the figure pulling down the night sky, a gesture that points to the mutability of context and our agency to move and even play within the confines of fixed meaning. In all my work, I am interested in the ways in which meaning is derived from an ever-shifting and always-constructed edge, and how within this boundary we are confined and contorted but also held and supported. We are subject to but can also be activated by these limits, a paradox outlined by the writer Joshua Gamson: Fixed categories of identity can be used to marginalize but, paradoxically, can be used by the marginalized to gain visibility and political power.ImageGuanyu Xu\u2019s \u201cLighting Up\u201d (2018).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Yancey RichardsonImageXu\u2019s \u201cInside of My Drawer\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Yancey RichardsonBy Guanyu Xu, 27, based in Chicago\u201cLighting Up\u201d (2018) is from my \u201cOne Land to Another\u201d project, which is partly a response to the lack of Asian representation in mainstream culture. I take on different characters and create these cinematic images \u2014 they\u2019re almost like film stills. In 2018 and 2019, I visited Beijing and installed these images, temporarily, in my childhood home. My parents don\u2019t know I\u2019m gay, and it\u2019s an environment where that sort of expression is not encouraged, so it was a rebellious act, a way of disrupting the heterosexual structure that\u2019s embedded in the home and familial relations. But it was also an exploration of intersectionality and the fact that I\u2019m not completely free there or here. In the United States, I\u2019m a gay person and a foreigner. I\u2019m very cognizant of how systems of oppression are used as a means of control, and I\u2019m looking to bridge dialogues about both countries, which in certain ways are quite similar.ImageDarryl DeAngelo Terrell\u2019s \u201cI Look Like My Momma (Self-portrait 1980)\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artistImageTerrell\u2019s \u201c#Project20s (Don, 22, Chicago, 2017).\u201d\u00a0Credit...Courtesy of the artistBy Darryl DeAngelo Terrell, 29, based in DetroitGrowing up in Detroit, I never felt I could perform any gender other than male. But around 2015, during my first year of grad school, I started experimenting with gender performance and expression with my alter-ego, Dion, as a way of exploring fat, femme, queer, black bodies. \u201cI Look Like My Momma (Self-portrait 1980),\u201d is referencing two images \u2014 Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s \u201cSelf Portrait, 1980\u201d and James Van Der Zee\u2019s \u201cCouple in Raccoon Coats, 1932.\u201d I borrowed my mom\u2019s raccoon-and-fox fur coat and gold necklace for it and took the photo in a peacock wicker chair reminiscent of those I used to see in our family photos. I sent the image to my mom and she said, \u201cDamn, boy, you look good. You look like me.\u201d\u201c#Project20s\u201d started in 2017, when I was doing an independent study at Ox-bow and around a lot of white people listening to Taylor Swift, which was irritating. I, meanwhile, became fixated by the fact that both Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West have songs about the likelihood of black kids not making it to a certain age in their 20s, while also thinking about how heavily gentrification was hitting both Chicago and Detroit. My aim is to photograph upward of 200 black or brown people in their 20s by the time I turn 30 \u2014 Don, the young person pictured in the second image, was an art student who died in an ambulance after the EMTs took an unhurried approach to his asthma attack. I want for this series to live in museums or gallery spaces where it will confront the people privileged with leisure time. Gentrification is a form of racial violence, and my thinking is, \u201cIf you kick us out of our hood, I put us on your white walls.\u201dImageNina Chanel Abney\u2019s \u201cIssa Saturday Study\u201d (2019).\u00a0Credit...Courtesy of the artistBy Nina Chanel Abney, 38, based in Jersey City, N.J.\u201cIssa Saturday Study\u201d (2019) is essentially a study for another painting I made titled \u201cIssa Saturday\u201d for my 2019 exhibition \u201cNeon\u201d at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla. The painting serves as an investigation of how and why we as a society choose to celebrate the Fourth of July when black people are still not free from the oppressions of this country.ImageD\u2019Angelo Lovell Williams\u2019s \u201cWas Blind, But Now I See (Granny)\u201d (2018).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Higher Pictures/Janice Guy GalleryBy D\u2019Angelo Lovell Williams, 27, based in New YorkI treat images like portals. My current exhibition, \u201cPapa Don\u2019t Preach,\u201d (open by appointment at Janice Guy\u2019s space, in collaboration with Higher Pictures, at 520 West 143rd Street in New York) looks at intersections of blackness, queerness and family. This image from the exhibition, \u201cWas Blind, But Now I See (Granny)\u201d (2018), narrates a moment between my mom\u2019s mom and me. The title, a line from the song \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d refers to an experience where my Granny was dead for 10 minutes after going into cardiac arrest over a decade ago due to smoking cigarettes. She was resuscitated but was blind, couldn\u2019t speak and couldn\u2019t walk. It was a sort of rebirth for her, especially religiously. Over the last decade, my granny has, with the help of family and friends, slowly regained her speech, her ability to walk and her sight. When she started speaking again, she recalled seeing God during the 10 minutes she was dead. The gesture of her hand over my face is a way of her sharing that testimony with me through touch. The use of the gaze is prominent in my work, and here, Granny\u2019s gaze is mine and hers at once, even if we don\u2019t always agree. With images existing as these portals, I continue to seek how life as a black, queer, H.I.V.-positive person intertwines with the depths of kinship, intimacy and history.ImageTroy Michie\u2019s \u201cDistorted In the Interest of Design\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artistImageMichie\u2019s \u201cDivided Territory\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artistBy Troy Michie, 35, based in New YorkI created these works last summer for Frieze London, but they are extensions of a project I started in 2016, when I delved into the history of zoot suits and pachuco culture as they existed in my hometown of El Paso, Texas. The town also has Fort Bliss, the second largest Army post in the country, so I grew up seeing camouflage everyday, and collage was a way of unpacking both of these histories while exploring questions of race, gender and sexuality. As part of my research, I revisited Ralph Ellison\u2019s \u201cInvisible Man\u201d (1952), which describes the zoot suiters as men who existed outside of their time and also has the line, \u201cWhen they approach me they see only my surroundings.\u201d \u201cDistorted In the Interest of Design\u201d (2019) looks at what it means to be invisible but also hyper-visible, which is the reality of being black or brown in this country. For the series, I mine an archive of \u201970s-era erotic magazines with fetishistic images of black men photographed through the gaze of white photographers. Using the centerfold, I draw clothing onto the nude models and then cut and weave the magazine pages back together. The process is additive and subtractive and, above all, a type of photographic disruption. In \u201cDivided Territory\u201d (2019), I affixed actual pieces of clothing. There are shirt collars, pockets, waistbands and cuffs \u2014 places where the body connects.ImageNikita Gale\u2019s \u201cRECOMMENDATION\u201d (2018-19).\u00a0Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Commonwealth and Council, Los Angeles. Photo: Ruben DiazBy Nikita Gale, 36, based in Los Angeles\u201cRECOMMENDATION\u201d (2018-19) is a fabricated steel barricade sculpture. In thinking about the infrastructure of crowd control, I became interested in the ubiquity of barricades at protests and other large public gatherings like concerts and political rallies. Barricades have origins in a very radical material tradition, having been made out of refuse by the working classes in 19th-century France to block and redirect the flow of street traffic as a means of protecting themselves against state violence. These structures also served as social spaces and ad hoc stages for these citizen insurgents to address one another. Through the advent of mass production, barricades have become a mobile architecture that controls how crowds and audiences are allowed to take up space; they are no longer technologies of the people but technologies of authority, and the freedom to speak and to listen is negated by the physical control rendered by the barricades\u2019 presence. \u201cRECOMMENDATION\u201d considers exclusion and protection, radical expression and the regulation of speech and listening.ImageDavid Alekhuogie\u2019s \u201croscoe\u2019s long beach 34.0407\u00b0 N, 118.3476\u00b0 W\u201d (2018).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Commonwealth and Council, Los Angeles. Photo: Ruben DiazBy David Alekhuogie, 33, based in Los AngelesThough my work draws from my own experiences and emotions, my practice is fundamentally political. My 2018 \u201cPull-Up\u201d series explores sagging \u2014 the style of wearing low-hanging pants that was popularized by hip-hop. The closely cropped compositions abstract the body into landscape, a political arena where people express their agendas and fantasies regardless of whether they mean harm or not. The photographs are often crafted in the studio, borrowing from the language and symbols of commercial advertising and alluding to the omnipresent commodification of the assumed bodies. The identities of the models are hidden, which draws upon the viewer's fantasies. With works like \u201croscoe\u2019s long beach 34.0407\u00b0 N, 118.3476\u00b0 W\u201d (2018), I rephotographed the studio shots of the waist area outside, conflating the bodily landscape with the urban landscape and light of Los Angeles, the city where I was born and raised, and where young black men have lived and died.ImageElliott Jerome Brown Jr.\u2019s \u201cOftentimes, justice for black people takes the form of forgiveness, allowing them space to reclaim their bodies from wrongs made against them.\u201d (2018).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, New YorkImageBrown\u2019s \u201cPrune and grout\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, New York By Elliott Jerome Brown Jr., 26, based in New YorkThe top image is from one of the rare occasions when I was invited to make photographs in a documentary context. I attended the funeral of a person who had a storied life, despite having suffered an incredibly traumatic racial violence early on.

I noticed that those who had been closest to this person moved through the day with ease \u2014 mostly they seemed proud and at peace \u2014 and it made me think about the power the deceased had and whether forgiveness was a tool for cultivating that power. A lot of my work involves interiority, both of physical spaces and of individuals \u2014 I\u2019m interested in what constitutes their foundation and enables them to act.

It was the Harlem theater\u2019s first amateur night, and Fitzgerald was just 17. Her friends had dared her. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t go, you\u2019re chicken,\u2019\u201d she would later recall in a 1978 television interview with the pianist and composer Andr\u00e9 Previn.

Designed by the American architect George Keister, the neo-Classical music hall was built for burlesque performances in 1914, when Harlem was largely white and African-Americans were not allowed in, but in 1933, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia cracked down on burlesque, and the following year the theater was transformed into a venue for variety revues. Harlem was 70 percent black by then, and the Apollo, on 125th Street, now open to black performers and audiences, became \u201cmonumental,\u201d as the legendary Motown singer, writer and producer Smokey Robinson described it to me. \u201cIn the lobby,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a mural with people I had grown up hearing about: Sammy Davis Jr., Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Duke Ellington \u2014 and Ella Fitzgerald, of course.

Courtesy of Hauser & Wirth\u2018I always want the work to be a resting place for black people.\u2019By Amy Sherald, 46, a Baltimore-based painterI realized very quickly, once I crossed into painting the black figure, that we are a political statement in and of ourselves, especially when we\u2019re hanging on the walls of museums and institutions. Because of that, I knew I didn\u2019t want the work to be marginalized any further, and I didn\u2019t want the conversation to be solely about identity or politics \u2014 our images deserve more than that. And that accounts, I think, for why I paint in grayscale.For a long time, I felt the work wasn\u2019t good enough. But then I started asking the right questions: If I hadn\u2019t been born in Columbus, Ga., where I had to perform my identity based on how the lines were drawn down in the South, who would I be? If I wasn\u2019t so aware of my blackness because it had been placed against the stark white background of my private school, how would I see myself?I was excited by American realism in the early 2000s and began thinking about how I hadn\u2019t seen any work about just black people being black, captured in moments that were nothing special. For years, I\u2019ve been trying to find the language for what draws me to my subjects, most of whom I\u2019ve cast by just running into them while out living my life, then photographing and painting them. I still can\u2019t explain it, but I always use this example of walking into a room and catching the eye of someone warm and familiar-looking and thinking, \u201cHuh.\u201d If these people were furniture, they\u2019d be like antique furniture, like midcentury modern, you know what I mean? They seem as though, in their spirit, they\u2019ve been around for a while. I always want the work to be a resting place for black people, one where you can let your guard down among figures you understand.Yet white collectors continue to ask me if I\u2019m ever going to paint white people. It\u2019s interesting to me because it shows me they recognize the absence of themselves in a room full of my paintings but don\u2019t recognize the absence of us in the greater narrative. I always tell them, \u201cYou should go look at a history book and get back to me. Thumb through and take note of how many times you see something that looks like this, and then let\u2019s have another conversation.\u201d \u2014 As told to N.B.ImageFrom left: James Jackson Jr., Larry Owens, L.

Jackson, 39, a New York-based playwrightWhen I think about the now popular idea of \u201cconfronting the white gaze\u201d in theater, I think about the fact that I was born into a black family in a predominantly black city (Detroit), where I attended a black church and predominantly black schools taught by predominantly black teachers alongside predominantly black students. The first boys I kissed were black. The first boys I did anything more than kissing with were black. When my father would sit me down to tell me about the evils of the white man, I would roll my eyes because, at the time, the man I felt most spooked by was not some racist white man \u2014 it was my father, who was black. I grew up in such a black context that eventually I had to rebel against it. So I moved to New York City at 18 to study playwriting.In my college plays at New York University, as in most of the short stories and poems I had written in high school, the central characters were black. I remember taking a master class with the playwright Kenneth Lonergan, who brought in two white actors to read scenes from all of our plays aloud. Because this was a pre-woke world, I had to listen to them read my very black, Southern-born characters\u2019 dialogue in a \u201cThis Is Our Youth\u201d dialect. As cringe-worthy as that experience was, it was a seminal moment: the first time I recognized white consciousness as the default in theater. But while I recognized that, I was not intimidated by it, because my default consciousness had always been black. I saw the world through artistically, culturally and sociopolitically black eyes. Because of how race is constructed, I understood how whiteness shaped the world my blackness lived in. But I did not cater to it.In my musical \u201cA Strange Loop\u201d (which last year completed a run at Playwrights Horizons in association with Page 73 Productions and recently won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize in drama), the protagonist is a black queer man named Usher who is writing a musical about a black queer man who is writing a musical about a black queer man who is writing a musical about a black queer man ad infinitum. I constructed the play in this way in order to explore the interiority of a black man without having to sacrifice him to the trauma of slavery or police violence. I wanted to capture the everyday misery of being a self. For some, this structure is about \u201cconfronting the white gaze.\u201d For me, it\u2019s about what it\u2019s been since I first began writing stories: being myself. If being myself is confronting the white gaze, then I suppose the only way I can explain my supposedly confrontational strategy is by appropriating my favorite white gaze of all: that of the character Joanne in George Furth and Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 1970 musical \u201cCompany,\u201d in which she says, \u201cSometimes I catch him looking and looking. And I just look right back.\u201d \u2014 Michael R.

And so racism is therefore a preoccupation with control over the body and, in turn, disdain and desire are projected onto that body. There is one kind of blackness in America that\u2019s publicly praised \u2014 one that seems to support the general consensus of black worth \u2014 while the larger, more commonplace reality of American blackness is often ignored. I attempt to explore that duality in my practice.When I\u2019m making a work, I primarily think about the subject in the painting. They\u2019re always imagined individuals; I don\u2019t work with real people. My main objective, first and foremost, is to create a charismatic, interesting and complex character so that they can function as a true subject instead of an object. When I\u2019m thinking about them in relation to gaze, I think about the community I\u2019m from, which is the black community \u2014 I grew up in Harlem \u2014 so that\u2019s who I\u2019m imagining experiencing the work. That\u2019s the cultural framework in which I feel the work is best understood.Still, I\u2019m very skeptical of the fetishization of black artists that\u2019s consumed the current moment. I do not feel comfortable, for example, with my works being up for auction. It\u2019s entirely inappropriate and unnecessary to auction work, especially mine: I\u2019m a black American artist, and I paint black bodies. I\u2019m a descendant of slaves in this country, so it\u2019s unfathomable that people could come to me, with glee, to ask if I\u2019m excited about seeing my work, which shows black figures and bodies, being auctioned. That shows me that people have no real understanding of black American history, and they don\u2019t understand anything about me and the specificity of my ethnicity as a black person in America. It\u2019s over their heads. \u2014 As told to N.B.ImageWardell Milan\u2019s \u201cAmerika: Klansman, Theophilus\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and David Nolan GalleryImageMilan\u2019s \u201cAmerika: Klansman, Pulaski\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and David Nolan Gallery\u2018I am extending an invitation to the viewer to discuss issues that are troubling, prescient and fraught.\u2019By Wardell Milan, 42, a New York-based visual artistSome of my most recent collages deal with Klansmen, in the hopes of producing conversations about race relations, both contemporary and historical, here in America, especially given the rise of white nationalism from 2016 on. I am captivated by the people behind these masks. I think about their level of humanity. I think about how they exist in the world as people with souls, morals, jobs and families. We don\u2019t share the same beliefs in those ethics, but people have these roles within the Klan as individuals.I am interested in having straightforward conversations, and I am extending an invitation to the viewer to discuss issues that are troubling, prescient and fraught \u2014 issues that some may deem inconsequential. I\u2019m trying to communicate these conceptual narratives in a way that allows audiences from a number of different backgrounds to engage: I want to shift the focus of the conversation around predominantly white institutions so that the institutions that have grown around these hegemonic ideals can be restructured. I am not considering one specific audience when making the work. I am just focusing on the work itself, and how it relates to a white viewer, a black viewer and a transgender viewer depends on the viewer themselves. I cease to have a sense of ownership over my work once it leaves the studio, but I want the work to have life outside of me \u2014 to have agency \u2014 and for the audience to consider what I\u2019m trying to say. The goal is to create pieces that will be relevant long after I am here on this earth. They are my own personal pyramids. \u2014 As told to Tiana ReidImageRen\u00e9e Cox\u2019s \u201cRaje for President\u201d (1998), part of her \u201cRaje, a Superhero\u201d series.Credit...Courtesy of the artistImageCox\u2019s \u201cA Covid Wavelength\u201d (2020).Credit...Courtesy of the artist\u2018I\u2019m trying to create my own propaganda for the enhancement of black folks.\u2019By Ren\u00e9e Cox, 59, a New York-based visual artistIn my work, I return the power of the gaze to the subject \u2014 and usually my subjects are black. My subjects come off very strong and empowered. They don\u2019t fall into the stereotypes of black people that white people have created. That\u2019s something that has been interesting to present in the art world since 1993, when I was the first artist of color to blow up the black body to over seven feet tall and unapologetically return the gaze to the viewer. If you\u2019re presenting black people as victims, that goes a longer way to the bank, but that doesn\u2019t change the status quo of the power structure of racism (because racism is about power and economics). I have been more interested in upsetting that paradigm, in at least having the fantasy of having the power, if not the reality.A lot of my subject matter is me. I was born in Jamaica in 1960, and my family never made me feel like I was a victim. They always made me feel like I was on the same level as anybody else \u2014 intellectually and, though perhaps not penny for penny, economically. I certainly wasn\u2019t struggling. Coming from that background, I\u2019ve never had to walk with my eyes cast down to the floor because I couldn\u2019t make eye contact with somebody. I\u2019ve always felt that I was either on the same level or above people [laughs]. I never felt like I had to pretend to be lesser than in order to make Caucasians feel comfortable.I\u2019m trying to create my own propaganda for the enhancement of black folks. I\u2019m focused on people who look like me. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve returned the gaze: to let my people know that they don\u2019t need to have this subservient slave mentality. Returning the gaze is natural for me but there\u2019s a radical nature to it, too. A lot of artists don\u2019t want to talk about it because they\u2019re afraid. Some are comfortable with the monies and the accolades. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re not doing anything for the race. And they\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m just an artist. I\u2019m not a black artist, I\u2019m just an artist. I\u2019m not a black woman artist, I\u2019m just an artist.\u201d What are you talking about? When I walk into the room, they see I\u2019m a black woman artist. When they look at the work, they assume it wasn\u2019t Muffy in New England who made the work. Why are we running away from who we are? For whose benefit? I\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud and, as a woman, I\u2019m all-powerful. I am the giver of life. Put my ass on a pedestal. \u2014 As told to T.R.ImageCalida Rawles\u2019s \u201cRadiating My Sovereignty\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Various Small Fires, Los Angeles/SeoulImageRawles\u2019s \u201cReflecting My Grace\u201d (2019).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Various Small Fires, Los Angeles/Seoul\u2018I didn\u2019t think that making work would become about teaching my culture.\u2019By Calida Rawles, 43, a Los Angeles-based visual artistI learned how to swim much later in life \u2014 just seven years ago \u2014 and through the quiet laps and the breathing, it became very therapeutic for me. Whatever I was dealing with before I got into the pool, I didn\u2019t feel the weight of it after I got out. A few years ago, I started to think about how I could explore that in my art. I learned about water-memory theory: this idea that water retains the substance of things that run through it. I thought about that in regards to the Middle Passage and how many memories must be in that water.My parents didn\u2019t learn how to swim, and neither did their parents. That\u2019s a direct result of segregation. We didn\u2019t have access to pools growing up in Wilmington, Del., and my father would tell us stories of his own childhood spent on the Maryland Eastern Shore. Though his family lived just 10 miles away from the beach, they weren\u2019t allowed to go there except once a week. And even then they were only allowed on the boardwalk. The beach itself was a symbol of rejection.I was thinking about the residual effects of that, which manifest in the numbers: We in the black community have the highest rate of drowning. That fear still lives with us. So, ever since I was a little girl, I\u2019ve said, \u201cMy kids are going to learn to swim.\u201dIn my last series, \u201cA Dream for My Lilith\u201d (2020), I tried to work through this layered experience by putting black people and black bodies in water \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of emotion in that. I photographed and then painted girls swimming in and around the rippling waves and liquid blue, surrounded by flickering stars that form when light hits the water in the right way.With this work, I wanted to discuss the intersectionality of the black female experience, as well as the theory of triple consciousness, which stipulates that black women in this country view themselves through three lenses: the American experience, largely defined by white men; the female experience, generally written by white women; and the black experience, usually associated with black men. To make work, for me, is to seek a kind of spiritual healing from all of that. While I can\u2019t say gaze doesn\u2019t affect me, I try not to think too hard about what people want from me.It\u2019s funny, though, because I didn\u2019t think that making work would become about teaching my culture as much as it has. There\u2019s a whole black swimmer community that\u2019s reached out to tell me they\u2019re so happy I\u2019m depicting these images. And there are people who can\u2019t swim who love them, too, and they like to get lost in the beauty of just seeing us in water. Sometimes you want to see yourself in places you\u2019ve never been before. \u2014 As told to N.B.ImageMeleko Mokgosi\u2019s \u201cActs of Resistance I\u201d (2018).Credit...\u00a9 Meleko Mokgosi.

So I\u2019m always concerned with how I present the artists I work with to the world, particularly because I have positioned my work life in such a way that centers black artists. To me, that means paying attention to how we articulate the mission of the artists and their work, and to how they and their works will live beyond the gallery. We are challenging the historical narrative by amplifying the artists\u2019 intention and/or providing a context that is generally not examined or considered with depth.I have been with Jack Shainman Gallery for 12 years now, which has given me the opportunity to collaborate with so many artists who are disrupting and growing the canon. Last fall, we opened three exhibitions across our New York spaces with the 38-year-old Botswana-born artist Meleko Mokgosi, titled \u201cDemocratic Intuition.\u201d In his practice \u2014 which also includes figurative, cinematic painting \u2014 he takes existing texts and then annotates and injects them onto canvas, quite literally presenting a history that is a departure from Western hegemonic academia. Mokgosi\u2019s work is undeniably a challenge to the white gaze.But it\u2019s hard for me to only talk about Shainman or only talk about We Buy Gold, a roving gallery I started in 2017, which happens to center artists of color. They\u2019re both continuations of how I think, but the latter had a lot to do with circumventing the white gaze, or perhaps refusing it: I wanted to create exhibitions that had a different audience, that resisted the traditional elite white space that Chelsea represents. Many people don\u2019t feel like Chelsea is a space for them, even though it\u2019s an area in New York where there are hundreds of exhibitions a year \u2014 all free and open to the public. It\u2019s crucial for art workers to help develop future audiences, whether they\u2019re patrons or people who show up and participate. We Buy Gold interrogates the exclusionary ethos of Chelsea, and is a way to bring art closer to my own position, to where I live.Earlier this month, We Buy Gold opened \u201cFIVE,\u201d an online video group show curated by the New York artist Nina Chanel Abney, and released a publication, We Buy Gold\u2019s deconstructed manifesto, which not only includes contributions from the artists who have shown in each iteration of the gallery but is also another means of questioning how we present our cultural production. Even as we resist the traditional catalog, archives and publications are still important in terms of people looking back and knowing what we did, where we were at and that we were here. \u2014 As told to T.R.ImageRashid Johnson\u2019s \u201cTwo Standing Broken Men\u201d (2019).Credit...Photo: Martin Parsekian.

Courtesy of David Kordansky Gallery, Los Angeles, and Hauser & Wirth\u2018We would never ask Picasso why he painted white people.\u2019By Rashid Johnson, 42, a New York-based visual artistWhat is the white gaze? Which white gaze? Most of my work has challenged the idea that blackness is monolithic. The fact that I and artists like me have so aggressively challenged that position calls into question why we might suggest whiteness is something so simple.I have people in my community who are white \u2014 friends, family, people who influence and participate in my work. If it\u2019s their gaze that we\u2019re discussing, then it\u2019s quite an informed one. If it\u2019s a bigoted white gaze, then it\u2019s different. But I don\u2019t imagine the latter having much access to my work. All of that is to suggest that I don\u2019t believe there is a white gaze that we can speak about without delving into the complexity of whiteness.We need to have these conversations: What whiteness are we talking about? Is it the white liberal? The white New Yorker? Is it European whiteness? Is there a privilege that is also qualified by a real financial agency as opposed to poverty? This produces different kinds of perspectives. Although we like to imagine that white privilege is inherently linked to white wealth, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s clumsy at best. I\u2019m as guilty as anyone of referencing whiteness with a tremendous implicitness.I was quite lucky because of how I was raised in Chicago. My mother and father took it upon themselves to introduce me to a black literary and intellectual tradition at an early age. I never had to search. There was never a suggestion that they didn\u2019t exist. There are other artists and black thinkers who have had to more or less discover what they felt was an underground world of black intellectualism, having gone to schools that put more of an emphasis on white and Western traditions. When they discover black thinkers, it\u2019s a revelation to them. For me, it was never a revelation \u2014 it was the way things were \u2014 so I don\u2019t conjure black literary figures in my work as an opposition to the white underlying concepts and traditions that someone would probably think I\u2019m reacting against. I\u2019m not.We would never ask Picasso why he painted white people. We wouldn\u2019t position him as an outsider, and yet we consistently find new ways to position the work of black artists as inherently being in response to the obstacles presented by a white world. I\u2019m just speaking from how I understand the world, how I see it. And at the center of my world is not whiteness. \u2014 As told to T.R.ImageMary Lovelace O\u2019Neal\u2019s \u201cRunning With My Black Panthers and White Doves aka Running With My Daemons\u201d (circa 1989-90).Credit...Courtesy of the artist and Mnuchin Gallery\u2018I didn\u2019t try to make work for black people or brown people or white people or red people or yellow people or crazy people.\u2019By Mary Lovelace O\u2019Neal, 78, an Oakland-based painterI ran to the studio so that I didn\u2019t have to consider anybody or anything, and I\u2019ve always said that my work was my way of freeing myself \u2014 from students, from my own teachers, from concepts that I had accepted. There\u2019s this painting I made in the early \u201980s called \u201cMeaningless Ritual, Senseless Superstition\u201d that has to do with coming into your studio and maybe jumping around three times, lighting your candles, emptying all of your cigarette butts and sweeping. There are these things I had to do every time to get all of that \u201coutside stuff\u201d out of my head.Whenever I was teaching \u2014 at U.C. Berkeley or the San Francisco Art Institute or the California College of the Arts in Oakland \u2014 I would come home and maybe have dinner or take a shower, and then I would get dressed. I\u2019d put on earrings and makeup and my work clothes \u2014 a blue work shirt and corduroy trousers or a wool or cotton dress, my favorite lab coat, my clogs \u2014 and go to the studio. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but what I was doing through those little rituals was cleansing myself so that I could get rid of all the awful work my students were doing and all the horrible stuff I was seeing in the museums where I was taking those kids, and in the galleries where I\u2019d go for openings. In my studio, I would try to come into myself. I didn\u2019t try to make work for black people or brown people or white people or red people or yellow people or crazy people. That wasn\u2019t it. I was there to deal with my stuff, to deal with me.I knew early on in the days of the civil rights movement, when I was at Howard University as a young student and artist, that I didn\u2019t have the ability to do what lots of artists could do, like those Cuban artists and those artists in Chile in the \u201960s who were making these incredible heartbreaking prints that talked about the pain of oppression and taught you how to resist it. I didn\u2019t think I could make work that was strong enough to voice what needed to be said in that call-to-action kind of way.But I am so thrilled when I see people who do really know what they\u2019re talking about, like the painter Joe Overstreet, who was one of my best friends back then, or Kerry James Marshall now. I love Kerry\u2019s work, and I love, even more than that, the way he talks about it: how he digested what he learned, and what school meant to him, and how he makes things legible for people. For me, though, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to move anybody to do anything like that. All I could do was put myself on the line. \u2014 As told to N.B."}, null, null, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/silk-road-travel-issue.html", "title": "The Silk Road\u2019s Enduring Romance, and Eternal Influence", "summary": "", "authors": "By Hanya Yanagihara", "text": "The Silk Road\u2019s Enduring Romance, and Eternal InfluenceLast May, when our known world was one way, we began planning these stories.

We cannot remember, often, how we learned of it, only that knowledge of it seems to be a birthright: It may not be the first story of human movement, recorded or otherwise, but it is the most abiding.At its most prosaic, the Silk Road was a series of trade routes that began thousands of years before the Common Era and lasted until (depending on who you ask) the 15th or 16th century (though many scholars argue that it continued for much longer). Over the decades, as kingdoms rose and faltered and conquerors redrew broad swaths of what is now Central Asia, the Middle East and Southern Europe, the route swerved and shimmied, calving tributaries that crossed mountains and deserts and eventually even the sea. A map, for much of civilization, was a mere suggestion, a diary of conquest written in pencil, and one of the victor\u2019s privileges was the right to remake the world to his liking. Heading west from the ancient city of Chang\u2019an (now Xi\u2019an) in China trundled caravans of silk, tea, paper and spices, inching toward their terminus in Rome or Constantinople; heading east came glass, gold, silver and horses. The route was some 4,000 miles, and dangerous; the people who plied it did so knowing that they could be felled by perils both human and climatic, that at any moment, the lands they traversed could become hostile territory.ImageA map illustrating the cities that T\u2019s contributors journeyed to for the May 17 Travel Issue alongside some of the many routes of the ancient Silk Road.Credit...Map by Daniel WagnerAnd so why did they persist, these early travelers? For one thing, there was their curiosity, their craving for the new, as fundamental to our condition as hunger or thirst. It wasn\u2019t just new objects or technologies that they encountered on the route, either: It was new ideas, new religions, new philosophies. Buddhism and Islam were both conveyed eastward on the Silk Road. To travel was to risk not only physical danger, but a different, headier kind of risk as well \u2014 the chance that you might discard what you\u2019d always believed for some other ideology altogether. This was a tribal age, and the road could change you so profoundly that you might never again be welcomed back home.For another, there was the allure of adventure. Yes, the path was dangerous. Yes, you might never see your family again. But movement is also intrinsic to the human experience. It is why the romance of the Silk Road endures all these years later: Although you can interpret it as the first, most durable experiment in capitalism, you can also see it as a testament to not just our desire, but our need to explore. Every traveler who leaves home therefore follows in the spirit of our Silk Road forebears, stepping out of our known world in the hopes that we might be dazzled.ImageOne of the two covers of T\u2019s May 17 Travel issue.

And so last May, when our known world was one way, we began planning these stories. By last month, when we were finishing work on this issue, the world was another way.Yet as I read these pieces, I realized that the Silk Road has more lessons to offer us in this moment than I\u2019d previously thought. Because while it is a reminder of our desire for interconnectedness, it is also a reminder that although open borders and movement bring wonder and awe to our lives, they can also bring war and disease. Over the course of the Silk Road\u2019s operation, humanity had to face some of the worst illnesses in recorded history, from the Justinian plague of the sixth century to the Black Death of the 1340s to a global syphilis outbreak in 1495 to a tuberculosis epidemic in the 1500s to the second cholera pandemic of 1826. The Justinian plague killed up to half of the global population at the time. Eight hundred years later, the Black Death killed as many as 100 million \u2014 nearly a quarter of the global population.But through all of these horrors, through all of these sorrows, the road continued. Trade continued. The need to discover new things and new people, to look down the road ahead, continued. What else could they do, those long-dead travelers? They could no more ignore what they desired than they could unlearn what centuries of exploration and interaction had taught them. The only way through was forward.It is the same for us now, too. The only way through is forward. Let us find some comfort, though, in the knowledge that we are preceded by centuries of human endurance, those travelers who remind us that every journey, no matter how difficult, ends with our finding our way back."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/xian-china-food.html", "title": "Eating in Xi\u2019an, Where Wheat and Lamb Speak to China\u2019s Varied Palate", "summary": "", "authors": "By Ligaya Mishan", "text": "ImageEating in Xi\u2019an, Where Wheat and Lamb Speak to China\u2019s Varied PalateIn the city\u2019s Muslim Quarter, meals are a celebration of globalization and ethnic diversity \u2014 and a lasting defense against erasure.ImageA dumpling steamer outside one of the shops in the Muslim district of Xi\u2019an in central China, where locally cultivated wheat \u2014 once foreign to the country \u2014 is now crucial in the preparation of dumplings, noodles and bread.Credit...Emma HardyBy Ligaya MishanMay 11, 2020IN THE VAST departure hall of Shanghai\u2019s decade-old Hongqiao Railway Station, an epic writ in 80,000 tons of steel, everything looks new and tired at once, tinged with gray \u2014 even the October sunshine that filters down from skylights so high it can\u2019t quite reach the floor. This is architecture meant to set the soul asoar, but I am conscious only of how far I am below, in the horde at the gates. Down the stairs, the bullet train waits, sleek-nosed and sealed in on itself, like a missile. A stoic janitor steers a Zamboni-like machine down the platform, buffing it to a gleam. When the train sets off, it feels like nothing: the slight give of a door unlatched. If I don\u2019t look out the window, I can imagine myself absolutely still.The Chinese government started laying intercity high-speed track in 2005, and today, its network is the longest and most heavily relied upon of any nation\u2019s. Six hours are enough to devour the over 900 miles from Shanghai to Xi\u2019an, the landlocked capital of Shaanxi Province in China\u2019s central northwest, standing on the bones of the imperial city of Chang\u2019an. In the seventh and eighth centuries A.D., this was the center of not only China but the globe \u2014 the eastern origin of the trade routes we call the Silk Road and the nexus of a cross-cultural traffic in ideas, technology, art and food that altered the course of history as decisively as the Columbian Exchange eight centuries later. A million people lived within Chang\u2019an\u2019s pounded-earth walls, including travelers and traders from Central, Southeast, South and Northeast Asia and followers of Buddhism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism. All the while, Shanghai was a mere fishing village, the jittery megapolis of the future not yet a ripple on the face of time.ImageA map illustrating the cities that T\u2019s contributors journeyed to for the May 17 Travel Issue alongside some of the many routes of the ancient Silk Road.Credit...Map by Daniel WagnerWhen the train docks, I emerge from the metal cocoon into another hangar, swooping and skylit. Outside, Xi\u2019an is at once grander and more prosaic than its distant ancestor, a grid of choked streets traversed by a population verging on 10 million. It takes an hour to drive 10 miles into the oldest part of the city, a rectangle marked off by a moat and defensive walls 40 feet tall and 45 feet wide, which today are popular as an exercise circuit. (Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, once posted photographs of himself jogging along the cobbled ramparts.) When the taxi driver can\u2019t find the right alley, I continue on foot to my hotel, a converted house equipped with chic furniture and questionable plumbing, where a few days later the electricity will fail and the young staff, who have been busy icing cookies for Halloween \u2014 a holiday with roots among the Celts of Ireland two millenniums ago, as foreign to this country as Christmas \u2014 will scrounge up tiny Mickey Mouse-shaped candles for guests to light the way.At night, I walk alone, down pitch-dark lanes that yield to pedestrian malls and broad boulevards, tracking the icon of myself on my phone\u2019s maps app, one of the few unhindered by China\u2019s formidable firewalls. It works everywhere, even underground, in the sea of life churning through the circular underpass below the 14th-century Bell Tower \u2014 a former military alert system turned tourist attraction, lit up in red and green LED. Skyscrapers are restricted in this part of town, but there are KFC franchises and fake Apple stores that look like the real thing: minimalist white boxes with products posed like relics on maple altars. (The products at least are genuine, as I discover to my relief when I have to buy an emergency power cord.)The more we chase the past, the further it recedes.ImageA baker shaping sweet shuijing bing (crystal cakes) scented with orange and rose petal at Xi\u2019an\u2019s Jin Xiang Zhai.Credit...Emma HardyImageAt Xi\u2019an\u2019s Lao Liu Jia Paomo, the lamb-and-bread soup known as yangrou paomo (here, still in progress in the kitchen) is served with pickled garlic and chile (top right), alongside a plate of lotus root and other fresh vegetables.Credit...Emma HardyI HAVE COME TO Xi\u2019an, like many before me, to eat yangrou paomo in the old town\u2019s Muslim Quarter, a warren of aged alleys measuring roughly a square mile. It has been home to generations of the city\u2019s Hui, members of one of China\u2019s 56 officially recognized ethnic groups and the largest of the country\u2019s 10 Muslim minority communities. (As of China\u2019s last census, in 2010, there were 10.5 million Hui nationwide.) Hui is an inexact label for a people that comprises many sects, scattered across the country, with no language of their own. What they share is an ancestry often traced back to the first Muslim Arabs and Persians to enter China during the Tang dynasty, as merchants and, in the northwest, as mercenary warriors sent by the Abbasid Caliphate (A.D. 750-1258) to help quash the An Lushan Rebellion. In the early years of Islam, Muslim traders mostly bypassed the Silk Road in favor of crossing the Indian Ocean to the ports of southeastern China, where they were designated fan ke \u2014 \u201cforeign guests\u201d \u2014 a foreignness that persisted even for their children by Chinese wives: tusheng fan ke, \u201cnative-born foreign guests.\u201d As the British Sinologist Michael Dillon has chronicled, Islam didn\u2019t truly take root in the country until five centuries later, when the Mongol leader Genghis Khan and his successors conquered almost a quarter of the globe and forcibly marched as many as three million Muslim soldiers, along with untold numbers of Muslim artisans, scientists and scholars, from Central Asia to China. Under the rule of his grandson Kublai Khan, their descendants intermarried with the locals and were accepted as Chinese, becoming known as the Hui.At Lao Liu Jia Paomo, a clattering, no-nonsense canteen, the meal begins with an empty bowl and a pale round of flatbread, steamed and crisped until it\u2019s hard on the outside but still spongy within. All customers are enlisted as prep cooks: Before we can eat, we must tear the bread into a hundred tiny pieces to fill that bowl. The ideal size for each piece, I\u2019m told, is that of a soybean \u2014 otherwise \u201cthey judge you,\u201d says Hu Ruixi, who with her American-born husband, Brian Bergey, runs the Xi\u2019an-based food-tour company Lost Plate. She sits across from me, wrists flicking in practiced gestures as she reduces the bread to rubble. The same task takes me longer, my fingers fumbling as I try to get the pieces small enough, twisting and pinching, and I imagine the chefs sneering at my scraps.I end up with a coarse confetti that looks like popcorn dregs, which I return to the kitchen with a paper ticket dropped on top so the servers can remember whom it came from. Soon the bowl is thunked back down on the table, the bread now submerged \u2014 mo meaning \u201cbread\u201d and pao \u201csoak\u201d \u2014 in a fennel-laced broth of lamb bones simmered for half a day, with fatty cuts of yangrou (lamb) on top. There\u2019s a side saucer of pickled garlic cloves, sharply sweet, to suck on as a respite from the lushness. The painstaking demolition makes sense: The smaller the nubs of bread, the better they absorb the soup. The drenched crumbs suggest a proto-noodle, as if knots of raw dough had been dropped directly into the broth to boil and set. It\u2019s life-affirming; I can feel a plush new layer forming under my skin, protecting me from winter.ImageDiners sharing meat skewers outside Sun Tao Kaorou, one of the many spots \u2014 each with its own secret recipe \u2014 that sell grilled lamb and beef in the Muslim Quarter.Credit...Emma HardyYangrou paomo belongs wholly to China\u2019s north. Lamb is a legacy of nomadic herding on the Eurasian Steppe that reaches from Mongolia to Hungary; Hu admits she isn\u2019t fond of the meat, having grown up in the south, in neighboring Sichuan Province. The presence of bread, too, attests to a geographical rift, marked by the Qinling Mountains just outside of Xi\u2019an, which run through the heart of the country from east to west, separating the cool north from the warm and humid south, the wheat fields from the rice paddies. It\u2019s a division that endures to this day, in both eating habits and character, between the collaborative rice farmers of the south, who had to rely on irrigation systems that bound them to their neighbors\u2019 fates, and the more independence-minded wheat farmers of the north, who tilled their fields alone.While rice is native to China \u2014 and so essential to Chinese culture that the word for cooked rice also signifies food \u2014 wheat was once foreign. It thrives on dry summers and winter rain, the opposite of the climate in northern China, and its migration here in the third millennium B.C. from the Fertile Crescent, a sweep of land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, was an early example of ingredients crossing borders, as the archaeobotanist Robert N. Spengler III notes in \u201cFruit From the Sands: The Silk Road Origins of the Foods We Eat\u201d (2019). For centuries, the Chinese ate wheat only out of necessity, and then only simply steamed, like millet, which did little to endear it to them. Wheat noodles appeared during the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220), but making them was laborious enough that they were reserved for the rich; milling technology, imported from Central Asia, did not become widely available until the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-907), when Persian merchants sold sesame-seed-studded cakes on the street corners of Chang\u2019an. Today, wheat is unequivocally Chinese: The government devotes more land to its cultivation than any other nation, and the grain is the foundation of entire genres of dishes, from noodles and dumplings to bread steamed, baked or fried.\u201cWe think of globalization as a uniquely modern phenomenon, yet 2,000 years ago too, it was a fact of life,\u201d the British historian Peter Frankopan writes in \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World\u201d (2015). But arguably, globalization \u2014 the passage of goods, beliefs and peoples from one part of the world to another \u2014 began here, in this valley fed by the Wei River, in the lost splendor of Chang\u2019an.ImageA pan-fried beef pancake at Jia Wu Youhuxian.Credit...Emma HardyImageBicycles parked under an ancient tree dating back to the Tang dynasty.Credit...Emma HardyTHERE WAS NO China, only a collection of squabbling states, before the short-lived but powerful Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.) brought terror and unity to the land. The Qin were the first to stake their capital here, on the Wei River, but the country\u2019s Han majority \u2014 now the world\u2019s biggest ethnic group, more than a billion strong, representing nearly one out of every six people on earth \u2014 take their name from the Qin\u2019s successor, the Han dynasty, which raised a new capital nearby, Chang\u2019an, in 202-200 B.C. Not long after, the emperor Wudi sent an envoy to the West: the dawn of China\u2019s engagement with civilizations beyond its frontiers. Where the landing of Europeans in the Americas in the 15th century was sudden and calamitous, the Eurasian cultural exchange happened slowly, over centuries, between nations meeting as relative equals.The trade routes \u2014 strengthened and expanded under the Tang dynasty in the seventh century \u2014 were never known as the Silk Road to the people who walked them. The German geographer Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen wielded the term in 1877, in support of 19th-century Western colonialism; the name tells us only what the West took from the East. Certainly the Roman Empire spent a fortune in its lust for Chinese silk, a scandalous cloth that some critics believed left women as good as naked and that was all the more desirable for being difficult to procure. But the Chinese had wants, too: horses from Central Asia for their armies. And as the Romans fantasized about a land beyond their horizons, the Chinese exalted the otherness of the countries to their west. In \u201cThe Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T\u2019ang Exotics\u201d (1963), the American Sinologist Edward H. Schafer writes of Chinese aristocrats enthralled by the customs of erstwhile \u201cbarbarians\u201d; one moony prince set up a Turkish camp on palace grounds and sat there dressed like a khan, slicing boiled mutton with his sword. Soon, Western influence had become so pervasive that the early ninth-century poet Yuan Zhen warned about the risk of losing Chinese customs in the quest for crass novelties:Ever since the Western horsemen began raising smut and dust,Fur and fleece, rank and rancid, have filled Hsien [Chang\u2019an] \u2026Women make themselves Western matrons by the study of Western makeup;Entertainers present Western tunes, in their devotion to Western music.Nostalgia for the Silk Road was, until the past decade, a Western indulgence. But in 2013, President Xi Jinping explicitly invoked the Silk Road as the inspiration for a multibillion-dollar, transcontinental investment in infrastructure, domestic and abroad, over land and sea \u2014 encompassing roads, railways, pipelines and ports \u2014 to tighten the connections between East and Central Asia, Europe and Africa, expanding China\u2019s sphere of influence. Key to this new global dominion is boosting the laggard economies of western China, which have missed out on the boom of coastal cities like Shanghai. Xi\u2019an\u2019s Muslim Quarter, \u201conce dilapidated and little mentioned in any local brochure,\u201d as the Chinese anthropologist Jing Wang has written, is now being promoted as \u201cone of the living testimonies to the cosmopolitan spirit\u201d of the Silk Road.ImageLamb-innards soup at Gui Fang Zhai.Credit...Emma HardyImageBiang biang noodles at Ma Zhen Mian.Credit...Emma HardyOn a bright and chilly Sunday morning, the main street of the quarter is thronged by tourists, mostly Chinese, clutching skewers like neutered swords. Every other storefront seems to sell them, meat of all kinds (except pork) impaled and charred, even whole baby squid, which Hu, my guide, warns against: \u201cAre we anywhere near the ocean?\u201d Instead, we head for narrower alleys. In one shop, a young man yanks belts of dough back and forth, snapping them down on the steel counter with a biang biang, a sound so singular that the convoluted Chinese character for it \u2014 which doubles as the name of the resulting noodles, heaped with garlic and chile, and then glossed with hot oil and vinegar \u2014 doesn\u2019t even appear in modern dictionaries. It\u2019s a swirl of sub-characters, among them those for \u201cmoon,\u201d \u201cheart,\u201d \u201cspeak,\u201d \u201ccave\u201d and \u201chorse,\u201d requiring more than 50 strokes; cruel teachers have been known to assign the writing of it as a punishment for tardy students.Down another lane, Jia Wu Youhuxian is mobbed, but by locals. Jia Yu Sheng, the 73-year-old owner, has been making the house specialty since he was 16: thick pancakes with shining layers as translucent as vellum, brimming with beef and spring onions. Now, he keeps vigil over his sons, Jia Yun Feng and Jia Yun Bo, as they pull the dough into kerchief-thin panels that stretch but do not break. Half of each panel is heaped with meat and gilded with sauce, then rolled into a rough ball, while the other half is left long and stretched further still, into a rippling ribbon, and then it, too, is furled and the ball is pressed flat and fried into a great gold coin. The layers multiply, flaking, perfumed with fennel and its faint smack of menthol, another gift of the Silk Road.At Lao Liu Kaorou, Liu Xin Xian and his wife, Li Sai Xian, now in their 60s, have been selling beef skewers since 1987, out of what is essentially their living room. (They sleep upstairs.) The meat is dusted with salt, cumin and pulverized chile, but the secret, as with all barbecue, lies in the sauce, about which they will reveal nothing. \u2063\u2063Outdoor charcoal grills were recently banned as part of a government effort to ease pollution, and Liu feared that going electric would ruin the flavor of the meat; fortunately, the skewers, turned over a long trough of glowing red bars that resemble a xylophone, still come out blackened and smoky, and, as his wife points out, \u201cit\u2019s better for the environment.\u201d With retirement looming, they can only hope that their son \u2014 who borrowed their recipe for his own barbecue spot, which he runs with a friend a few blocks away \u2014 will keep the tradition alive. \u2063ImageAnother popular barbecue place, Liu Jia Ganbang Kaorou, has been open for more than four decades; it\u2019s now a local landmark, often drawing a line out its door.Credit...Emma HardyAS WE WALK, we pass a man in a white skullcap standing on a ladder, daubing paint on a restaurant sign. I begin to notice other signs with little scars: a swath of paint or tape or otherwise improvised appliqu\u00e9 to hide the Arabic script and symbols that vouch for the cooking as halal \u2014 coverings mandated by the government as part of a crackdown on Islamic expression. The main targets of this campaign have been the Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who are concentrated on China\u2019s northwestern frontier in Xinjiang, a late and reluctant annexation to the Chinese Empire in the 18th century. Since the 1950s, the state has encouraged Han migration to the region, diluting the Uighur majority and overriding their culture. Unrest has been met with ever-increasing police controls and surveillance, and in the past few years, more than a million Uighurs have been detained in hundreds of re-education camps, which officials have characterized as correction facilities and job training centers. While news analysts have framed the conflict as primarily ethnic rather than religious \u2014 as well as geopolitical, intensified by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of Turkic Muslim republics bordering Xinjiang \u2014 in 2015, President Xi Jinping openly called for the \u201cSinicization\u201d of Islam throughout the country, extending beyond the Uighurs to the Hui. In Xi\u2019an, the hijab, gaitou in Mandarin, was banned at Shaanxi Normal University, and a Hui protest against the sale of alcohol in the Muslim Quarter \u2014 along with a nationwide call by the Hui for proper regulation of halal (qingzhen) food \u2014 was exploited on social media to provoke fears over the rise of Shariah, the legal code of Islam (jiaofa), as a threat to secular Chinese culture.For centuries, the Hui have lived, for the most part, quietly alongside the Han, although the relationship has never been easy. The American anthropologist Dru C. Gladney has observed that the Hui often experience a degree of \u201cphysical and linguistic invisibility\u201d alongside their Han neighbors and are sometimes identified dismissively as \u201cHan who do not eat pork.\u201d Still, that dietary distinction reveals a deeper schism: Pork is considered essential to China\u2019s culinary heritage \u2014 Mao declared it a \u201cnational treasure,\u201d and the character for jia, meaning \u201cfamily\u201d or \u201chome,\u201d depicts a pig under a roof, honoring the animal that over millenniums kept many Chinese alive in times of scarcity, surviving off scraps and requiring little land \u2014 and rejection of the meat can be read as rejection of China itself.Little acknowledgment is given to Muslim contributions to Chinese civilization. After the decline of Chang\u2019an and the Tang dynasty, when Baghdad, the seat of the Islamic empire, became the new cultural center of the world, Muslim scholars and artisans brought China advances in medicine, mathematics, astronomy and the arts, from metalwork and glassware to the cobalt pigments that would become the signature of Chinese porcelain. Under the Mongols, the Hui were privileged over the Han and revered as masters of finance, responsible for a new prosperity. But this holds no sway in more recent historical memory; as the American anthropologist Maris Boyd Gillette has written, Chinese officials tend to portray the Hui as \u201cfeudal\u201d and \u201cbackward,\u201d with \u201ca racial predisposition to violence,\u201d harking back to a Hui uprising in the northwest in the last half of the 19th century that was suppressed so savagely, it was reported that out of Shaanxi\u2019s 700,000 Hui, no more than 60,000 survived.ImageLamb hanging at Ma Yin Gui, one of the Muslim district\u2019s butchers that specializes in the meat.Credit...Emma HardyImageZaoni su \u2014 pastries baked and filled with red date paste \u2014 at Xi\u2019an\u2019s JIin Xiang Zhai bakery.Credit...Emma HardyEven as China is embracing internationalism, proposing partnerships with more than 60 countries as part of its New Silk Road initiative \u2014 which would effectively mean touching the lives of two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, a neo-imperialist reach greater than even Genghis Khan\u2019s \u2014 it still seeks to promote conformity within its borders, both ideologically and, increasingly, in the definition of what it means to be Chinese. Gladney has argued, controversially, that the elevation of the Han as the standard-bearer for Chinese culture is a relatively new construct, with roots in late 19th-century Japanese nationalistic ideology. It\u2019s a rigid conception that, he believes, has displaced \u201cmore indigenous Chinese notions of identity\u201d \u2014 ones that accepted and honored difference, rather than tried to subsume it.KUBLAI KHAN consolidated power in 1279 as the self-declared Yuan emperor, head of the first non-Han dynasty to rule all of China. It lasted barely a century and is remembered for its brutality. But Yuan feasts, as documented in \u201cProper and Essential Things for the Emperor\u2019s Food and Drink,\u201d a dietary manual codified for the Chinese court in the 14th century, offer a more complicated picture of the tension between conquest and assimilation. The Mongol influence was clear, especially in dishes involving lamb, every part used, as described by the Chinese biochemist Hsiang Ju Lin in \u201cSlippery Noodles: A Culinary History of China\u201d (2015): deep-fried tendons, air-dried intestines, raw liver, ears, tongue and whole heads garlanded with kidneys, stomach and lungs. A number of ingredients, such as red currants and smartweed, were not cultivated but foraged from the wild, following the folk wisdom of the steppes. At the same time, imperial menus also reflected \u201ca collective culinary heritage,\u201d the American scholars Paul D. Buell and Eugene N. Anderson note in \u201cA Soup for the Qan\u201d (2010), and included Turkic noodles, Tibetan tsampa (roasted barley flour) and dishes from as far away as Baghdad and Kashmir. This was \u201ca deliberate attempt to represent the Mongolian world order in visible, tangible, edible form\u201d \u2014 the empire made manifest on the table, in a show of might.ImagePineapple rice, a popular street-food dish in Xi\u2019an\u2019s tourist-thronged markets.Credit...Emma HardyThe breadth of Chinese cuisine today is still testament to those disparate origins. Historically, scholars divided Chinese cooking into four major regional styles, a pantheon expanded to eight in the early 20th century, but both classifications left out much of the country, betraying a bias toward the eastern coastal provinces and the south. Chinese foodways are manifold, both hyper-regional and micro-regional; a recipe beloved in one part of the country may be unknown in another, or so altered to suit the local palate, it no longer counts as the same dish. Partisans will insist that the best Sichuan food \u2014 from a region in the country\u2019s southwest famed for its juxtaposition of huajiao (Sichuan peppercorns), at once floral and numbing, and brazen chile \u2014 belongs to Chongqing, wholly committed to flame, while others champion Chengdu, ever so slightly gentler and sweeter; the cities lie less than 200 miles apart. Within Xi\u2019an, Hui and Han alike eat roujiamo, the Chinese hamburger: meat tucked into flatbread that\u2019s been crisped on the grill until it shows tiger skin on one side \u2014 shades of orange and black \u2014 and a chrysanthemum whorl on the other. The Han make it with long-braised pork, doused with a spoonful of its own broth, and the Hui with beef or lamb, stewed, then salted and dried.But the triumphal Mongol table, stocked with delicacies from far-flung, hard-won territories, is long gone. For much of the 20th century, Chinese historians treated the Mongols as an aberration, a so-called alien dynasty that was inevitably doomed to collapse because they stayed mired in their \u201cbarbarian\u201d ways and failed to adopt Han customs. Only in recent decades has the Communist Party begun to extol China\u2019s status as a multiethnic state, not out of a desire to promote diversity but to underscore the idea that minority groups have always been part of China and thus owe their primary allegiance to the Chinese nation, legitimizing the government\u2019s control over potentially restive populations. The cultural heritage of minorities can be tolerated and even celebrated, like the food in Xi\u2019an\u2019s Muslim Quarter, so long as the deeper rituals behind it remain hidden. One folk tale collected in the 1994 anthology \u201cMythology and Folklore of the Hui, a Muslim Chinese People\u201d tells of Hui men who journey to Chang\u2019an during the Tang dynasty and are permitted to take Han wives. When the wives\u2019 parents ask what the Hui are like, the women confess that they can\u2019t understand what their husbands are saying \u2014 but that \u201ctheir food is good.\u201d The concluding moral is almost flip: \u201cEat Hui food; there is no need to listen to Hui words.\u201dImageOne of the two covers of T\u2019s May 17 Travel issue.

Here, Zhangye Danxia National Geopark in Gansu, China.Credit...Zhang XiaoI think of this as I walk the knotted streets of the Muslim Quarter, trying to listen. Then, on my last day, I dutifully head northeast of the city to see what every tourist in Xi\u2019an comes to see: the tomb of the first Qin emperor. He died while traveling in the east, reportedly in search of life-prolonging herbs, and his corpse was brought home in a convoy of carts loaded with salted fish, to disguise the stench and keep the news from the public until royal counselors had settled on a malleable successor. His subterranean necropolis, larger than the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, is reportedly contoured with man-made rivers of liquid mercury \u2014 it has yet to be excavated \u2014 and houses the bodies of the craftsmen who built it, who were sealed in at the last moment so they would never reveal its secrets. Eight thousand terra-cotta statues of soldiers were posted at its gates to guard the emperor in death, only to be shattered by a vengeful warlord and lost to history until 1974, when shards were discovered by local farmers digging a well.This is the past, forgotten, recovered and revised for each generation. Restorations here are still underway, although enough statues have been put back together to draw daily throngs, a living legion to face off with the dead. I steel myself for a nationalistic display of raw power, an overwhelming assembly poised to conquer. Instead, I feel a strange lightness, hemmed in by the crowd, gazing down into the great ashen pit. History belongs to the powerful, not those who serve them, but here the emperor is absent. How individual the soldiers are, six feet tall and dressed forever for battle, hair braided and wrapped in a tight bun tilted to the right or flattened beneath a cap or plated crown. I didn\u2019t know we\u2019d be so close that I could look them in the eye. Only from a distance are they an army; this near, each has a face entirely his own. Some seem caught midstride, cast down in thought, with a trace of a smile. Others brood and glower, or lie in parts on wheeled steel tables, as if in a makeshift hospital. They are beautiful, these broken sentinels, still half animated by the flesh-and-blood warriors who were their models, and by the invisible artisans who carved each knuckle, each puckered sleeve. Unmoored from their mission, they wait. Among them stand conscripts from minority peoples who were vanquished and swallowed up by empire. Their eyes and cheekbones are evidence: We, too, were here.Ligaya Mishan is a writer at large for T. Emma Hardy is working on a monograph called \u201cHomework\u201d and is based in London.

The nearest town was Dunhuang, 110 miles to the southeast. Enormous yardangs \u2014 curving sandstone and mudstone strata carved by winds \u2014 towered over us. Others floated on the far horizon.\u201cYou mean the singing sands?\u201d I asked. On my map, an asterisk marked this strange feature of the Kumtag Desert, three miles from Dunhuang. If you throw yourself down the dunes in that place, the air resonates \u2014 sometimes like the lowest note on a cello; sometimes like a crack of thunder.\u201cNot the singing sands,\u201d the guide said. \u201cI mean voices. Like ghosts. Do people in the West think they exist?\u201dThe Chinese pilgrim and scholar Xuanzang wrote in his A.D. 646 book \u201cThe Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions\u201d that in this desert region, travelers often heard singing and shouting, shrieking and crying. Disoriented, they would wander, get lost and die of thirst. More than 650 years later, the 13th-century Italian merchant Marco Polo described the same phenomenon; sometimes the voices would even call a traveler by name. \u201cIf you\u2019re thirsty enough, and exhausted, and afraid, I guess you might hear things,\u201d my guide murmured. He was looking away from me, into the maze of eroded landforms. We were tiny as pixels on an Imax screen.The Kumtag is a little desert (9,000 square miles) between the Taklamakan Desert (130,000 square miles) and the great Gobi (500,000 square miles), which covers much of northern China and southern Mongolia. The Chinese have named the giant yardangs here: the Sphinx, the Golden Lion Greeting Guests, the Western Sea Fleet. But the Uighurs, the minority ethnic group who populate this region, know the geopark simply as the Old City, because its sandstone promontories resemble the ruins common throughout China\u2019s western provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang: ancient walls, beacon towers and gateways created not by wind but by conscripted soldiers.The desert rolled away in every direction, gunmetal grains mixed with golden ones. The day was almost windless. Around the sands and huge yardangs, the air was silent.ImageA map illustrating the cities that T\u2019s contributors journeyed to for the May 17 Travel Issue alongside some of the many routes of the ancient Silk Road.Credit...Map by Daniel WagnerFOR MORE THAN 2,000 years, a branch of the Silk Road \u2014 the 600-mile-long Hexi Corridor \u2014 has angled southeast from the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts to the Yellow River loess plains. The Hexi is hemmed in by deserts to the north and west, and by the great Qilian mountain range to its south. It is about 10 miles wide at its narrowest point, with oasis towns every 50 to 100 miles. For most of the Han dynasty, which lasted roughly from 206 B.C. to A.D. 220, no soldier, pilgrim, explorer or trader could enter northwestern China without first passing through the corridor, which was vigorously guarded. In A.D. 123, the imperial secretary Chen Zhong, in a strategic memo to the emperor, translated in 2009 by John E. Hill, wrote that if the Western Regions were not defended, \u201cthe wealth of the [nomadic Xiongnu tribes] will increase; their audacity and strength will be multiplied,\u201d and the four garrisons along the Hexi Corridor would be endangered. \u201cWe will have to rescue them,\u201d he continued. The great cities of China\u2019s central plain, including the capital, would then be left vulnerable to attacks.Until the scientific map surveys of the 20th century, one of the best sources on traveling to the borderlands of western China was Xuanzang. The Buddhist pilgrim and scholar left the Tang capital Chang\u2019an (today\u2019s Xi\u2019an) in A.D. 629 and traveled westward across deserts, then into India through the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. \u201cThe roads are lost in a vast waste, and its limits are unfathomable,\u201d he wrote, as translated in 1996 by Li Rongxi. The ancient literary term for the deserts west of Dunhuang is \u201cRiver of Sands,\u201d denoting a place where travelers were guided only by the stars and the bones of men and animals; no other landmarks or signposts existed.According to a seventh-century biography of Xuanzang written by two of his disciples, Huili and Yancong, on his journey, Xuanzang survived an attempted kidnapping, several murder attempts and, while deep in the Gobi, the loss of all his water. In these stories, he crossed the deserts and mountains alone and once hallucinated that an army appeared in the wastes: \u201cSometimes they advanced and sometimes they halted. \u2026 The glittering standards and lances met his view; then suddenly fresh forms and figures changing into a thousand shapes appeared, sometimes at an immense distance and then close at hand, and then they dissolved into nothing.\u201d The scholar Jeffrey Kotyk has pointed out that these accounts (cited here from a 1911 translation by Samuel Beal) are likely imagined or embellished; Xuanzang probably traveled with a merchant caravan. The stories, however, convey the potential perils of such a trip.After studying in India for almost 14 years, Xuanzang returned to Chang\u2019an, bringing sutras, works of art and knowledge about the world beyond China\u2019s borders. So thorough was his \u201cRecord of the Western Regions\u201d that dozens of 19th- and 20th-century explorers \u2014 Russian, British, German, French and Japanese \u2014 used it to find forgotten settlements more than a thousand years after the Taklamakan Desert had swallowed them. When foreign archaeologists found an ancient town, they defined it by longitude and latitude, and then tried to match its site with one of Xuanzang\u2019s vanished cities: Khotan, Kucha, Agni.ImageThe sandstone landform known as \u201cthe Louvre\u201d in the Binggou (Ice Valley) scenic area of Zhangye Danxia National Geopark in Gansu.Credit...Zhang XiaoIN THE 2015 history \u201cBy Steppe, Desert, and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia,\u201d the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe described how medieval Central Asia was a region \u201clike no other in the world.\u201d Here, the cultures of China, Persia and India mingled with one another and with the world of the steppe. Nomadic raids and invading armies brought down kingdoms while the Buddhist monasteries provided a measure of stability amid the turbulence. \u201cA kind of unstable equilibrium prevailed,\u201d Cunliffe wrote. I knew these landscapes from classical Chinese books; I had fallen in love late but hard with the poets of China\u2019s Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-907), especially Wang Wei, Du Fu and Li Bo. Li Bo is one of China\u2019s most beloved poets, even though he may not even have been Han Chinese, as the scholar Paula Varsano noted in her 2003 history \u201cTracking the Banished Immortal: The Poetry of Li Bo and Its Critical Reception\u201d: Some theories suggest he was born of mixed ethnicity on the borderlands or in the nomadic regions beyond them. China\u2019s northern and northwestern frontiers have a unique place in its classical literature, the scholar Stephen Owen explained in his 1996 book \u201cAn Anthology of Chinese Literature\u201d: \u201cThere was the awareness of a clear division between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019 Frontier poetry often speaks of the crossings and incursions such divisions create.\u201dThe Tang poets were writing when China\u2019s empire was at its most powerful and the Silk Road networks at their most vibrant. I hoped to find remnants of that world in remote Gansu. Among the poorest of China\u2019s provinces and autonomous regions, Gansu has largely been spared the overdevelopment that blights the country\u2019s richer districts. Roughly the size of California, Gansu arcs from Mongolia at its northernmost point down to Sichuan Province in the south. The geographical center of China is near the city of Lanzhou, in the province\u2019s southeast, while to the far west it borders the Xinjiang region, a place that under the Tang marked the extreme frontier. (Today, Xinjiang is the site of hundreds of mass internment camps, where more than a million individuals from China\u2019s Uighur and other Indigenous ethnic groups are being held indefinitely without trial by the government.)In classical Chinese literature, the boundaries existed not just between peoples and geography but between order and chaos. I had mapped out a route: I would begin where Xuanzang had begun his own journey, in Xi\u2019an, China\u2019s capital during the Tang dynasty. I would travel northwest through the Hexi Corridor\u2019s former garrison towns: Zhangye, Jiayuguan and Dunhuang. After Dunhuang, I would cross into Xinjiang and end my journey in the northwestern city of Turpan, on the northern Silk Route.XI\u2019AN IS AN inland city about 800 miles northwest of Shanghai. From within its walls, caravans once set out carrying silk, perfumes, bronze mirrors and jade \u2014 goods and artistry that would eventually make their way to the great cities of Samarkand, Damascus and Constantinople; other caravans arrived from the West, bringing grape seeds, glassware, horses and gemstones. The Tang poet Bai Juyi compared the city\u2019s layout to \u201ca great chessboard.\u201d Chang\u2019an\u2019s greatest avenues were 482 feet wide \u2014 three times the breadth of New York City\u2019s Broadway. Later dynasties preferred more sober palettes, but under the Tang, civic architecture shone with color. Writers and artists celebrated the bluish stones of the capital\u2019s winding Dragon Tail Way, the brilliant shades of the flower gardens of its mansions and the vermilion walls and flagstones studded with precious gems of the Palace of Great Luminosity.In the early 880s, Chang\u2019an was sacked and the palace burned by an army rebelling against the Tang. The Sinologist Edward H. Schafer, in his 1963 paper \u201cThe Last Years of Ch\u2019ang-an,\u201d recorded how soldiers pillaged the city and occupied it for more than a year before being driven out; they looted it and left, \u201cdripping gems along the road.\u201d By 904, Schafer wrote, Chang\u2019an was nothing but earth heaps and wasteland. A hundred years later, the palace would not appear in Song dynasty gazetteers. The old capital had disappeared everywhere but in ancient poems.ImageAt Matisi (Horse\u2019s Hoof) Temple, about an hour south of Zhangye, a series of Buddhist grottoes, dating approximately to the fifth or sixth century, are connected by tunnels and stairways that have been carved into the cliff.Credit...Zhang XiaoImageA view from what is called the Overhanging Great Wall, originally built in 1539 during the Ming dynasty, about five miles from the Jiayuguan Pass. Situated on the eastern slopes of the Heishan (Black Mountains), the wall was hidden to travelers coming from the west.Credit...Zhang XiaoMy first night in the city, I wandered through the districts near Wenhua (Culture) Alley. Every building was concrete, but salvaged stone fragments heaped outside shop fronts recalled a more elegant past: white bas-relief panels carved with blossoms, deer and flaming pearls of wisdom; seal script characters chiseled into scattered blocks; and guardian lion sculptures, some so eroded that they had no eyes. A boy on a Segway floated past me, its wheels glowing an intense blue. I tasted ashy grit in the air. An old man from the Hui Muslim community was exercising on a metal cross-trainer: Public gym equipment filled a small park. Outside a market nearby, a sign warned, in Chinese and English: \u201cWarm Prompt: You Have Been Into Video Surveillance Area.\u201d Everywhere cameras tracked people moving through streets and rooms and markets, eating, talking, shopping, crossing streets, scrolling through smartphones.I thought of \u201cThe Tower of Myriad Mirrors,\u201d a 1640 novel by Tung Yueh, who later became a Buddhist monk and Chan (Zen) master, translated in 2000 by Shuen-fu Lin and Larry J. Schulz: \u201cThe four walls were made of precious mirrors placed one above another. In all there must have been a million mirrors.\u201d The main character, Monkey, becomes disoriented. An old friend appears and explains: \u201cEach blade of grass, each tree, everything moving and still, is contained here.\u201dOver the course of my three weeks in China, I saw cameras shaped like black teardrops, or clustered together like grapes on a trellis; there were lenses locked like Janus heads facing away from each other, and others shaped like starbursts. Some cameras had triple eyes; others resembled mandalas or Marvin the Martian. The most elaborate, which I noticed near high-value objects or in especially sensitive areas, looked like a spider missing an eye.The best cameras were invisible \u2014 the ones I knew were there but could not see.\u201cXINJIANG!\u201d CALLED THE speaker at noon the next day. His voice echoed through the glittering vaults of Xi\u2019an\u2019s railway station. \u201cXinjiang!\u201d I was traveling to Tianshui, a city with roots in the Neolithic era, near one of the oldest archaeological sites in northwestern China, where remains dating back to 5000 B.C. have been discovered. The bullet train took a little under two hours to go about 200 miles. I passed scarps and junkyards glinting with shattered plastics and glass, graveyards on hills, a giant iron woman cradling a gilded sheaf. There were dry riverbeds and golden poplars, pomegranate trees and pylons. On the hills, radio towers; smoke from distant fires floated over the terraced fields.I arrived in Tianshui an hour before sunset. Here was a city of flyover walkways and half-built skyscrapers that ran mile after bleak mile along the dirty waters of the Jie River. Tianshui was once surrounded by high gateways and spectacular city walls, whose lines followed the river. Modern Tianshui has lost those walls: Only the very oldest residents remember they once existed. As evening fell, I explored Nanguo Temple in the southern hills above Tianshui. The mountain air was clear and very cold. Over the doorways to their bedrooms and kitchen, the Buddhist monks had tacked up calligraphy written on thick paper, enigmatic jokes and prayers. One read: \u201cAt night there is no place to stay.\u201dImageThe rainbowlike mountain range in the Zhangye Danxia National Geopark, in the northern foothills of the Qilian Mountains in Gansu. The unique shapes and colors are the result of deposits of sandstone, iron and other minerals, as well as shifting tectonic plates.Credit...Zhang XiaoIn A.D. 759, the poet Du Fu took refuge in the area after resigning from his government post near Chang\u2019an. Du Fu, translated here by Stephen Owen, excelled in describing the human cost of the Tang dynasty\u2019s imperial ambitions, the suffering of individual soldiers who protected the Silk Road and defended the country\u2019s distant borders: \u201cAlready gone far from the moon of Han, / when shall we return from building the Wall? Drifting clouds journey on southward at dusk; / we can watch them, we cannot go along.\u201dThe next morning, I left early to climb up to the former Buddhist monastery complex Maijishan (Wheat-Stack Mountain), 30 miles south of Tianshui, to see the art of its temple caves. Sited midway up sheer vertical cliffs, Maijishan was founded in the Later Qin dynasty (A.D. 384-417) as an isolated retreat where Buddhist monks from Chang\u2019an might meditate. When I visited, the contrast between Tianshui and these ancient ruins \u2014 between industrial wasteland and classical landscape \u2014 was extreme. Maijishan was remote enough that its paintings and sculptures were spared during wars and revolutions, when other cultural relics were destroyed; they still record what the art historian Michael Sullivan in his 1969 history \u201cThe Cave Temples of Maichishan\u201d described as \u201cthe metropolitan style of [the sometime capital] Luoyang in its brief glory.\u201d Certain statues resemble the art of sites in Xinjiang; others are more closely related to styles found in India. In the third volume of her magisterial study \u201cEarly Buddhist Art of China and Central Asia\u201d (2010), the scholar Marylin Martin Rhie traced links between Maijishan\u2019s sculptures and the artworks of other Silk Road monastic centers. In some of the figures\u2019 flowing drapery, and in the \u201cdelicacy of the linear outlines and contours of the features of the faces,\u201d she found the influence of Greco-Buddhist artists from Gandhara, a region that once straddled the modern border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the waving hairstyles, Rhie found similarities to the sculptures of Tumshuk, a site near Kashgar. Connections between Maijishan and the ancient centers of what is now Xinjiang were particularly strong: Some bodhisattvas wore three-sided jewel crowns that also adorned paintings and a wooden statue at the Kizil Caves of Kucha, the ancient Buddhist kingdom north of the Taklamakan, while a distinctive pearl-band design also occurred in one of Kizil\u2019s earliest caves. Near Maijishan were roads leading not just west through the Hexi Corridor and on to Central Asia but also south to Chengdu and east to Chang\u2019an. Maijishan was secluded, Sullivan wrote, but \u201copen to influences.\u201dThe monastic community here was in a remote, wild place set among green mountains, bamboo groves and cornfields. Many frescoes have been exposed to the elements, and as a result, the paintings are poorly preserved. Buddhas are set into Maijishan\u2019s cliff face; they resemble smaller versions of Afghanistan\u2019s Bamiyan statues, which were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. The sixth-century poet Yu Xin recorded how a military governor \u201chad a path like a ladder to the clouds constructed on the southern face of the rock,\u201d and commissioned a series of Buddha sculptures as a temple offering in his father\u2019s memory: The cave \u2014 Scattered Flower Pavilion \u2014 still exists, although the entire front section was sheared away in A.D. 734 during an earthquake, a temblor that also divided Maijishan\u2019s west side from its east. Other caves that Yu Xin described \u2014 the Moon Disc Palace and the Hall of Mirrored Flowers \u2014 may have disappeared altogether. But the surviving Buddhas and celestial beings carved into the mountain look out over a spectacular view that cannot have changed that much in the last thousand years. \u201cFor a hundred li,\u201d Du Fu wrote, \u201cyou can make out the smallest thing.\u201dMaijishan also contained some of China\u2019s most beautiful sculptures. In the Cave of the Steles, a Buddha stretched his hand down toward a smaller figure who might be a young monk or \u2014 according to my local guide \u2014 the historical Buddha\u2019s own son. Specialists are uncertain whether the two figures were created during the Tang dynasty or later, in the Northern Song period of A.D. 960 to 1127. Whatever its age, the Buddha had the most beautiful hands of any sculpture I had ever seen, and the space between the statues \u2014 the Buddha\u2019s outstretched fingers, the crown of the boy\u2019s head \u2014 was electric. Whether the two were greeting or leaving each other, I did not know; perhaps they did not belong together at all but had been brought here from separate caves. I crouched at the foot of the small statue, looking into its face. At the outer edge of another cave, a statue of a bodhisattva smiled slightly, her right palm raised in the gesture that means \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d During the 734 earthquake, the mountain collapsed a few inches past her right shoulder; on the jagged wall behind her, where the cliff met the sky, I could see a flying apsara and the curve of a halo \u2014 all that remain of some greater whole. Beyond rolled a green line of mountains, the dark blue sky and, jarringly, a cluster of security cameras and loudspeakers. Far below the wooden walkways that linked painted cave to cave, the bells on a donkey\u2019s harness sounded: Local touts had set up replica caravans for tourists to ride. Polo and his co-author, Rustichello da Pisa, wrote of the men traveling the Silk Road, here in Ronald Latham\u2019s 1958 translation: \u201cRound the necks of all their beasts they fasten little bells, so that by listening to the sound they may prevent them from straying off the path.\u201dI listened to that distant jangling and thought of the vast spaces ahead.ImageThe awe-inspiring and hostile landscape of the Binggou area at Zhangye Danxia National Geopark.Credit...Zhang XiaoTHAT EVENING, I got on another high-speed train to travel more than 400 miles west to Zhangye, which was once an ancient commandery \u2014 essentially a fortified administrative center \u2014 on the Hexi Corridor. The train carriages were spray-painted with advertisements for the popular Wangyuan-brand camel milk. Security guards wearing modular utility belts and flak jackets followed the women checking train tickets. The Han Chinese heartlands were receding; we were entering regions where minority populations make up a higher percentage of the population. The farther west we went, the stricter the security protocols became.The desert was closer: The train passed roads white with dust. A scattering of sheep. Thorny apple trees. A crumbling Ming-era watchtower. Beneath the hills, the hollows were white with unmelted snow; in an abandoned garden near the tracks, fallen pears lay scattered around an ancient tree. A thin telecom needle. A temple. An earth-colored mosque. Razor wire and pylons. Ruined hilltop forts.The Qilian Mountains appeared, white, distant and dazzling. The entire carriage let out a collective cry of enchantment, cut short as we went into a tunnel; then again, the intake of breath, the cries, as the mountains appeared, closer this time, shattered prisms radiant with light. We went back into a tunnel, and I wondered if the train was climbing or diving. As we gained altitude, my pen oozed beads of ink; blood beat at my temples. The train was passing through Qilianshan No. 2 Tunnel, 11,834 feet above sea level. The Qilian Mountains, whose highest peak stands at 19,055 feet, mark the edge of the Tibetan plateau.The train passed grasslands where Han dynasty emperors bred their horses. The earth was dark and the rivers already half frozen. The Chinese first conquered this region in 121 B.C., by driving out the nomadic Xiongnu tribes, and the Tang historian Sima Zhen (A.D. 679-732) recorded an old nomad song lamenting that defeat: \u201cHaving lost our Qilian Mountains, our animals have no place to breed; having lost our Yanzhi Mountains, our women marry without splendor.\u201dDunhuang, ancient Shazhou \u2014 City of Sands \u2014 was still several hundred miles away. I would reach it the following day after crossing through the Jiayuguan Pass, the great gateway that during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) marked the end of China. In stories and songs, Jiayuguan represented the boundary between civilization and chaos. In 1942, the British missionaries Mildred Cable and Francesca French wrote in their memoir \u201cThe Gobi Desert\u201d that scholars and disgraced officials, en route into exile, had covered the fortress gateway with farewell poems written in calligraphy: \u201cAnyone with sufficient knowledge to appreciate Chinese penmanship could see at once that these were the work of men of scholarship, who had fallen on an hour of deep distress.\u201d When I finally visited it myself, I saw that the long archway had been painted clean, and security cameras tracked everyone going in and out. Chinese tourists stood against the walls, posed for selfies and moved on.ImageThe monochromatic sand dunes of Mingsha Shan near Dunhuang, with a modern reconstruction of a Ming-era temple complex that was destroyed in 1968.Credit...Zhang XiaoImageClimbing the dunes at Mingsha Shan, outside the town of Dunhuang in Gansu.Credit...Zhang XiaoTHE TOWN OF Dunhuang has a population of only about 190,000, but it is one of western China\u2019s most cosmopolitan centers, as visitors from all over the world arrive to see the Mogao Caves (also called the Thousand Buddha Grottoes) 15 miles to the southeast. According to legend, a fourth-century monk called Le Zun carved out the first cave by hand. Le Zun had planned to travel to India but stayed after he saw a vision of dazzling light, brighter than 10,000 suns, shining over the land. When I arrived at Mogao the next morning, the day was bright and cool; the leaves of ancient poplars and willow trees were just changing color, their golds reflected in the shallow waters of the Dachuan River.For almost a thousand years, artists added new caves until the cliff face was honeycombed with painted corridors and recesses. Some caves are niches, while others can hold more than 50 people. Patrons commissioned caves as acts of piety, and the art reflected the hopes of those living in or passing through Dunhuang \u2014 to cross the desert safely, or to be reborn in paradise. Other caves might have helped the devout to meditate. Open to the sun and the winds as late as the 1940s, they are now protected behind metal doors and preserved in climate-controlled environments. Gansu is a province remote from any great city, and its landscapes \u2014 green mountains, eroded karst cliffs, empty deserts \u2014 amplified the ancient artwork. Left in their original settings, Buddhas and flying apsaras, demons and monsters, are still numinous.Nothing prepares a traveler for the frescoes. No book, no photograph, can ever capture the color-saturated details, or the strangeness, of the art there. Visiting the Mogao Caves was an intensely sensual experience: Painted dancers\u2019 shadows moved, floating instruments made sound, incense billowed from the walls. The ninth-century Japanese monk Ennin, in a diary of his travels through the Tang empire, translated by Edwin Reischauer in 1955, remarked on the three-dimensional, illusionistic effect of one sacred painting: \u201cWe looked at [the image] for quite a while and it looked just as if it were moving.\u201d The Qing dynasty writer Pu Songling (1640-1715), in his book \u201cStrange Tales From a Chinese Studio,\u201d translated by John Minford in 2006, described a visitor to a Beijing monastery who went even further: He entered a painting and had a brief love affair with one of its flying apsaras. \u201cHe was wafted bodily up onto the wall and into the mural itself. He felt himself pillowed on clouds, and saw stretching before him a grand panorama of palaces and pavilions,\u201d wrote Pu. The man\u2019s senses were \u201csuffused with the heady perfume that emanated from her body, a scent of orchid mingling with musk.\u201dMogao\u2019s artists, most of whom were anonymous, painted not just Buddhist paradises but riots and the fall of cities. All life is depicted here, from the movement of stars to competitions between philosophers; wedding scenes, slaughterhouses, wandering storytellers. Markets, brawls, women putting on makeup. Magicians, hunters chasing animals. A house burning down, swimmers splashing through the sea.I went from cave to cave, intent on remembering every line, every color. In the last cave, I saw a recumbent Buddha, half asleep; the statue\u2019s eyes were full of sand.ImageAn arched tunnel looking onto Rouyuan Tower, the west gate of the fortress at Jiayuguan Pass, which, during the Ming era, marked the northwestern boundary between China and the lands beyond.Credit...Zhang XiaoImageA couple walks down the steps in the Binggou scenic area in Gansu.Credit...Zhang XiaoI LEFT DUNHUANG the next morning by taxi, heading for Turpan \u2014 500 miles away. An hour into the journey, a distant city floated. I looked at the map, then out my window again, dazed. I wanted to follow the shining line of trees, to walk through the shimmering gateways, to climb those towers.\u201cHaishishenlou,\u201d said the taxi driver, indifferent. He didn\u2019t even glance out the side window but just looked at me in the rearview mirror. \u201cIllusion.\u201dMy map showed nothing to the east for several hundred miles. In his 1926 memoir \u201cBuried Treasures of Chinese Turkestan,\u201d translated two years later by Anna Barwell, the German archaeologist Albert von Le Coq wrote that the Uighurs called this phenomenon azytqa, \u201cmisleader,\u201d adding that the mirage \u201cis so lifelike that many inexperienced travelers may very easily follow it.\u201d I would, too, if I had been driving. The nameless city looked far more alluring than the blank asphalt road. The vision traveled alongside the car, as if it were painted on the window glass. I knew, but did not want to believe, that it was unreal.Here, the Gobi changed from rosebud pink to black with rare streaks of ivory. The British-Hungarian explorer Marc Aurel Stein, in his 1920 piece for The Geographical Review titled \u201cExplorations in the Lop Desert,\u201d described the towerlike mesas near Dunhuang as quivering \u201cphantom-like in the white haze,\u201d and from a distance, the white bands among dark strata looked like mist rising over a river. But there was no water, just salt scattered along the dunes. In this region, Stein once wrote of \u201cnature benumbed.\u201dThe British diplomat Eric Teichman pointed out in his 1937 \u201cJourney to Turkistan\u201d that those traveling in the caravans called this area the Four Dry Stages: This road was among the most ferocious, the most fatal relays not just in Central Asia but on the entire Silk Road network. Beyond, springs of bitter water were the only landmarks: Wild Horse Well, Clear Water, One Cup Spring, Muddy Spring, the Well of the Seven Horns.These stretches took weeks to cross even in the 20th century: From ancient times until the 1960s, camel and donkey skeletons marked out the route. The poet Wang Wei, translated here by Stephen Owen, wrote a little verse to honor a friend who was leaving for these empty spaces. The poem ends: \u201cI urge you now to finish / just one more cup of wine: / once you go west out Yang Pass, / there will be no old friends.\u201dIf a traveler falls asleep in this desert, Polo wrote, when he wakes, he will hear invisible spirits talking to him as if they were his companions. They may even call him by name.I listened. I could hear nothing.ImageYardang formations in an area free of tourists near Dunhuang.Credit...Zhang XiaoFROM THE HIGH mountains to the lowest point in China: The city of Turpan lies on the northern edge of a geological depression that drops to 500 feet below sea level. It\u2019s at the heart of a region that Le Coq described as \u201ca gigantic bowl filled in the center with moving sand.\u201d The evening I arrived, the city radiated neon: hotel arches shimmering, boulevard trees sheeted in blue fairy lights, LED icicles gleaming from lampposts.

One participant in a 2018 sand-therapy study in Xinjiang said, \u201cI suffered pain, so it will work.\u201dThe Brutalist concrete architecture of downtown Turpan could be anywhere in China, but in certain districts, an older city still survives, if barely, on side streets lined with ancient poplars. The gateways of houses are painted with Persian flowers or hand-carved with abstract geometric patterns: This is the architecture of Central Asia, of the minority Muslim Uighur population. In his 1995 book \u201cFrontiers of Heaven: A Journey to the End of China,\u201d the travel writer Stanley Stewart described Turpan\u2019s old town bazaar: \u201cBathed in a ruby light filtering through the colored awnings which span the lanes, it was crowded with carpets, rolls of silk, coils of rope, saddlebags and endless piles of green grapes. The men wore tall boots, long coats, daggers and embroidered caps.\u201d Stewart especially loved the 18th-century Emin Minaret, which stands \u201cbeyond the town, its feet in a green sea of vineyards.\u201d In its adjoining mosque, \u201ccolumns and arches receded like a trick of mirrors.\u201d The day I visited, the mosque was echoingly empty, the only noise the wind flowing through the grapevines. The Uighurs emerged as a regional power around A.D. 750 in what is now Mongolia. Turpan has been a Uighur city since the ninth century, when the Uighurs migrated to the area and started the kingdom of Qocho. It was a kingdom, the archaeologist J.P. Mallory and the Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote in their 2000 book \u201cThe Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples From the West,\u201d that once \u201ccombined, apparently harmoniously, a myriad of different ethnic groups, religions and languages.\u201dImageOne of the two covers of T\u2019s May 17 Travel issue.

But always a few grains remained. Wherever I went, the desert came with me. Earlier that day, in the Putaogou district, or Grape Valley, I had watched Turpan\u2019s famous grapevines being \u201cput to sleep\u201d for the winter, their canes cut back and the central trunk coiled around its root. All over the city, farmers were tamping earth and leaves lightly over the vines; what was left looked like graves. I remembered lines from one of my favorite poems, written by Li Bo and translated by Rewi Alley: \u201cWe who live on the earth / are but travelers; / the dead like those / who have returned home; / all people are as if / living in some inn, / in the end each and every on / going to the same place.\u201dI had traveled nearly 1,500 miles from Xi\u2019an, but western China\u2019s spaces were so great, its mountains and deserts so vast, that I felt I had barely moved, that my journey had been a single stitch on an infinite bolt of cloth. I felt restless and hungry. I wanted to follow the sands toward Kashgar, or go deeper into the mountains, where the Ili River flows into Kazakhstan.The Tang poets were always searching for a way back to the center, for a return to Chang\u2019an. In Turpan, I left the Tang poets. Samarkand lay beyond the horizon: I wanted to go not back, but on.Anna Sherman is the author of \u201cThe Bells of Old Tokyo: Meditations on Time and a City\u201d (2019).

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission \u2014 the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.ImageA map illustrating the cities that T\u2019s contributors journeyed to for the May 17 Travel Issue alongside some of the many routes of the ancient Silk Road.Credit...Map by Daniel WagnerFOR THE FIRST six centuries after his death, the Buddha was never depicted in human form. He was only ever represented aniconically by a sacred synecdoche \u2014 his footprints, for example; or a parasol, an auspicious mark of kingship and spirituality; or the Wisdom Tree, also known as the Bodhi Tree, under which he gained enlightenment. How did the image of the Buddha enter the world of men? How does one give a human face to god, especially to he who was never meant to be a god nor ever said one word about god? How, in rendering such a man in human form, does one counterintuitively end up creating an object of deification? And what is the power of such an object?These were the questions that were uppermost in my mind as I drove to Sarnath among green fields whose red brick boundary walls advertised educational courses and aphrodisiacs. To pass through open country in India, surrounded by signs of every religion except Buddhism, from temples and mosques to churches and Sikh gurdwaras, was to feel the ghostly imprint that Buddhism had left in the land of the Buddha. Gautama, believed to have been born in the fifth century B.C., had lived and taught the entire duration of his 80-year life within 200 miles of where I was. His doctrine, partly a reaction to the rigidity of Vedic religion, or Brahmanism \u2014 widely seen in India as an early form of Hinduism \u2014 had flourished here for more than a thousand years, patronized and disseminated by kings.India\u2019s oldest stone architecture was Buddhist. There had been viharas, or monasteries, that stretched across the Indian mainland, from Sarnath in the north to Nagapattinam, deep in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. There were the glorious painted caves at Ajanta, in western India, and, most intact and enchanting of all, there was the great stupa at Sanchi, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The hemispherical stupa, among the earliest and most distinctive of Buddhist monuments, is a reliquary mound. With its origins in pre-Buddhist burial mounds or sacred tumuli, it retains a cosmogonic power. \u201cThe act of making the stupa,\u201d writes Richard Lannoy in his 2001 history \u201cBenares: A World Within a World,\u201d \u201cwas a rite in itself, on the analogy of creating the world \u2018in the beginning,\u2019 a symbolic re-enactment to get into the right relationship with the source of the Cosmic Order.\u201dImageA 14th-century Tibetan painting on cloth of Bhaisajyaguru, or the Medicine Buddha, who is typically depicted with blue skin and holding an apothecary\u2019s gallipot.Credit...Medicine Buddha (Thangka), circa 14th century, pigment on cloth, Tibet, Kate S. Buckingham Fund/Bridgeman ImagesThe remains of stupas and viharas are scattered all across India, including at Sarnath, but Buddhism, as a religion (though curiously not as a philosophical doctrine) left this land hundreds of years ago. \u201cIf Buddhist philosophy is alive anywhere, it is still in India,\u201d P.K. Mukhopadhyay, a philosopher in Varanasi, told me as I was researching my 2019 book \u201cThe Twice-Born: Life and Death on the Ganges.\u201d I had studied Buddhist writers, philosophers and poets as naturally as a student of Christianity would move between Old and New Testaments. But when it came to worship, it was an inarguable fact that just as the majority of those for whom Christ was the son of God lived outside the theater of his activities, the Holy Land, so too did the majority of those for whom the message of the Buddha was gospel live beyond the borders of India. This is the world\u2019s fourth-largest religion, with over half a billion adherents \u2014 about 245 million of whom live in China alone \u2014 but of which only 1.8 percent still live in the land of the Buddha.MANY EXPLANATIONS have been given for why Buddhism vanished from India. Some say its core teaching was absorbed into a resurgent Hindu faith \u2014 in one major branch of modern Hinduism, the Buddha is seen, somewhat controversially, as an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu \u2014 while others suggest that Buddhism grew too insulated and doctrinal. Mukhopadhyay gave me yet a different explanation: \u201cBuddhism did not have the social support,\u201d he said, suggesting that it was only ever a court religion, and \u201cregal support and social support are not the same thing.\u201d By the seventh century A.D., Buddhism had declined in India before the Islamic invasions of the 12th century dealt its universities and places of worship a devastating blow. The memory of the Buddha, however, lived on in the hearts and minds of Indians. They reacted to him as I imagine the residents of Memphis must react to those visitors to Graceland for whom Elvis is God \u2014 pleased that he was a local son but alarmed by the ardor of his followers.That did not stop multitudes of peddlers, hawkers, hoteliers and day-trippers from chaffering about Sarnath, which was full to overflowing. I picked my way through the low-lying slabs of Buddhist foundations, their red brick now black with time. The fragments of ruins lay all around me, here a splendid amalaka (or notched capping stone from a votive shrine), there, peering out from behind a tangle of steel wire, the smooth unadorned remains of a Buddhist railing, the ancient stone balustrades that formed a perimeter around the stupa, breathtakingly modern in the simplicity of their lines. Ahead, set among manicured hedges and neat flower beds, were the eroded remains of the Dhamek stupa.We know from two highly detailed accounts by the Chinese monks Faxian and Xuanzang, who visited Sarnath in the beginning of the fifth century A.D. and the middle of the seventh, respectively, that this had once been a vast monastery complex composed of hundreds of sacred monuments, where, according to Xuanzang, no fewer than 3,000 monks lived and taught. Opposite the stupa, he had seen a mighty column \u201cof blue color, bright as a mirror.\u201d The base of the stupa today, 93 feet in diameter, still conveyed solidity and strength, but its top half was worn down to a brick drum, hardly more impressive than the kilns that dotted the countryside in these parts.ImageA 19th-century Burmese illustration on parchment paper depicting the Buddha seated in padmasana, or lotus position.Credit...Bridgeman ImagesTo gaze up at the empty niches in its eight projecting faces, which scholars believe once held statues of the Buddha, long since destroyed or plundered, was to be reminded of how powerful an absence this figure could leave. The image of the Buddha, with all its iterations, from India to Japan, variant yet somehow changeless, is so literally iconic that we forget that the business of giving a face, let alone a human face, to divinity is fraught with anxiety.The history of religious art, from Byzantine iconoclasm to Islam\u2019s horror at representing any aspect of God\u2019s creation, is replete with examples of how provocative such an act was. In the case of Buddhism, the provocation was twofold: Early Buddhists did not regard the Buddha as a divine being but a great teacher. He could not be deified for the simple reason that although Buddhism, unlike Jainism \u2014 another doctrine, which emerged at the time of Buddhism, as a reaction to Brahmanic orthodoxy \u2014 is not actively nontheistic, it is so reticent on the subject of god as to virtually eschew him.The other problem with representing the Buddha in human form, as the great Sri Lankan art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy points out in his 1918 essay \u201cBuddhist Primitives,\u201d is that early Buddhism was disdainful of art itself. He writes: \u201cThe arts were looked upon as physical luxuries and loveliness a snare.\u201d Quoting the Dasa Dhamma Sutta, an early Buddhist text, Coomaraswamy adds: \u201cBeauty is nothing to me, neither the beauty of the body nor that that comes of dress.\u201d The relationship between religious and artistic expression is profound, but the evolution of one does not always coincide with the other. Before the early Buddhists found an aesthetic language of their own, they had to rely on a pre-Buddhist lexicon, no less than early Christianity had to borrow from Greece and Rome. In the case of the early Buddhists, the austerity of their doctrine stood in marked contrast to existing forms of non-Buddhist art in India, which were an expression of what Coomaraswamy calls \u201cthe Indian lyric spirit.\u201dEarly Buddhism, with all its severity, sought utterance against the background of Vedic religion. The Indian, non-Buddhist art of the time, with its cults of nature and worship of the elements, was in many ways antithetical to the Buddhist spirit. At Sanchi, one sees the strangest of all amalgams: the unornamented Buddhist railing and the spartan simplicity of the stupa competing for space in an overwhelming richness, a world populated by sensuous yakshinis, or dryads, leaning out of ornate brackets, like caryatids, along with drum-bellied dwarfs and the Guardians of the Four Quarters. The stupa, with all its primordial power, sits behind an ornate gateway, or torana, whose sculpted beams undulate, their playfulness culminating in whorled volutes, reminiscent of Ionic capitals.Sanchi represents a fascinating interplay of the pagan and the puritan spirit. The only real expression of the \u201cintellectual and austere enthusiasm\u201d of early Buddhism at Sanchi, Coomaraswamy felt, was the refusal to show the great teacher in human form. \u201cIn the omission of the figure of the Buddha,\u201d writes Coomaraswamy, \u201cthe Early Buddhist art is truly Buddhist: For the rest, it is an art about Buddhism, rather than Buddhist art.\u201dImageVarious stone and bronze Buddha heads, clockwise from top left: from Gandhara, in the Peshawar basin in modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, produced during the Kushan dynasty, between the third and fifth centuries A.D.; from Angkor, Cambodia, made during the Khmer Empire in the 12th century; from Cambodia or Vietnam, created around the fifth or sixth century; from Thailand\u2019s Ayutthaya kingdom, fabricated between the 15th and 16th centuries.Credit...Clockwise from top left: Head of Buddha, circa third-fifth century, schist, Gandhara, India, V&A Images/Art Resource, N.Y.; Head of Buddha, Khmer, 12th Century, Muse\u0301e des Arts Asiatiques-Guimet, Paris, Erich Lessing/Art Resource, N.Y.; Head of Buddha, fifth-sixth century, sandstone, Cambodia or Vietnam, Muse\u0301e des Arts Asiatiques-Guimet, Paris, Photo: Thierry Ollivier \u00a9RMN-Grand Palais/Art Resource, N.Y.; Head of Buddha, 15th-16th century, bronze, Ayuthaya, Thailand, Muse\u0301e des Arts Asiatiques-Guimet, Paris \u00a9 RMN-Grand Palais/Art Resource, N.Y.THE STORY OF how the image of Buddha finally broke forth into the world after 600 years of symbolism is one of the most intriguing in the history of art \u2014 one that is inextricably tied up with the advent of a new dynasty in India that, unconstrained by the conventions of the past, was able to set the image of the Buddha free into the world of men.It begins with the Kushans, descendants of pastoral nomads who emerged like a wind out of the Eastern steppe around the second century B.C. They were heirs to a dazzling hybridity, which included the first ever confluence of Greece, China, Persia and India. Evidence suggests that it was under their reign that a reconstituted form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana (Great Vehicle) Buddhism, flourished and was transmitted along Kushan-controlled trade routes, deep into the East, through China, and eventually Korea and Japan. It was this rare meeting of politics and faith that led to the discovery, Coomaraswamy felt, \u201cthat the two worlds of spiritual purity and sensuous delight need not, and perhaps ultimately cannot, be divided.\u201dIt is something of a miracle that the Kushans should ever have existed. Their progenitors, the Yuezhi, nomads who roamed the pastoral grasslands of modern-day Gansu, had been pushed out of China in the second century B.C. The Yuezhi drifted into northern Bactria, modern-day Afghanistan, which at the time was controlled by Greek kings, the residue of Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest. The Indo-Greeks lived in garrison towns that turned into cities, and numismatic evidence shows Demetrius I, who reigned in Bactria from about 200 B.C. to 180 B.C., wearing an elephant scalp as a symbol of his conquest of India. His successors, such as Menander I, converted to Buddhism and extended their kingdom deep into the Gangetic plain. It was this India, one fertilized by Greece, that the Yuezhi, now Kushans, inherited. Led by the marvelously named Kujula Kadphises, they conquered Greek Bactria in the first century A.D. That conquest, writes Craig Benjamin in \u201cEmpires of Ancient Eurasia,\u201d his 2018 study of the first Silk Roads era, which he dates from 100 B.C. to A.D. 250, \u201cwas the very first incident ever in world history that was commented upon by both Western (as in Greco-Roman) and Eastern (as in Chinese) historians.\u201d The Kushans, as if racing to meet their destiny as the bridge between East and West, would go on to become the quintessential Silk Road empire.ImageA painting of a multitude of sitting Buddhas on the walls of Ajanta, the caves of Maharashtra, India.

The rise of the Achaemenids in Persia around the time of the Buddha had produced the first truly global empire. Gautama\u2019s own semi-independent tribal state of the Shakyas, on the border of India and Nepal, with its capital at Kapilavastu, was less remote than we imagine. \u201cThe Uttarapatha,\u201d or the great northern trade route, writes Lannoy, \u201clinked the rich iron and copper deposits of the eastern Ganges region with the civilization of western Asia, bringing wealth to the merchants of Kapilavastu.\u201d This was a time described by the 20th-century German philosopher Karl Jaspers as the Axial Age. The stasis of localized cults and religions was giving way to the pressures of a new internationalism. It was no accident that the Buddha, with his universalizing meditation on the human condition, appeared at the same time as Heraclitus in Greece and the Taoist teacher Lao Tzu in China.Everywhere, across what was not yet the Silk Road, old enclosed societies were being changed by a new awareness of the world beyond. The Achaemenids had waged war with Greece, inadvertently exciting the future ambitions of Alexander the Great. In the wake of Alexander came the first centralized Indian state, the Maurya Empire, their founder known as Sandrocottus to the Greeks, Chandragupta Maurya to the Indians. The support shown by Chandragupta\u2019s grandson, Ashoka, of Buddhism in the third century B.C. had an electrifying effect on the fortunes of the new religion, not unlike that of Constantine\u2019s conversion to Christianity. It was Ashoka who is said to have erected the column of dazzling blue that Xuanzang saw at Sarnath in the seventh century A.D., and to have spread Buddhism in both India and Sri Lanka: Legend has it that he sent a mission led by his son and daughter, both carrying a branch of the Wisdom Tree and thus, Lannoy writes, \u201cliterally planting Buddhism in the soil of Sri Lanka.\u201d But it was the Kushans who turned Buddhism from a local Indian cult into a world religion.A GREAT PART of the Kushans\u2019 success lay in their receptiveness to the cultural influences around them. They displayed an extraordinary ability to assimilate and absorb the four major civilizations they encountered, turning syncretism, or the creative mixing of culture (in this case from Persia, India, Greece and China), into something of a competitive sport. In order to make a cohesive whole of their empire, which would come to look like a giant amoebic blob at the crossroads of four discrete civilizations \u2014 with one arm reaching deep into Central Asia, the other outstretched, as if in a game of Twister, into the very bosom of the Gangetic plain \u2014 the Kushans showed a willingness to sacrifice their own identity in order to meet the cultural demands of the world they had inherited. In place of their spoken tongue, Tocharian, the Kushans adopted Bactrian, which they called the \u201cAryan language,\u201d as the court language in what Benjamin sees as \u201cpart of an intentional policy change by the Kushan leadership.\u201d Bactrian, with its middle Iranian roots, gave the Kushans influence in the region, even as their use of Greek letters spoke of continuity with the past. To add to this dizzying hybridity, the Kushans adopted Buddhism, part of their ethos of tolerance, which also included the veneration of Greek, Indian and Zoroastrian deities.ImageA Tang-era painting made by Chang Huai-hsing in A.D. 897 depicting a golden Buddha surrounded by five planets: Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn.Credit...Tejaprabha Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-Hsing, Art Collection 4/AlamyThe greatest of all Kushan kings was Kanishka, great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises, and to look upon his headless statue from the first centuries A.D., now in terribly reduced circumstances at the shabby Government Museum in Mathura, 115 miles southeast of New Delhi, is to feel as profound a sense of cultural dislocation as I have ever known. He is made of red Mathura sandstone but dressed in nomadic riding boots, redolent of the steppe. Like a Rosetta Stone of statuary, it is possible to see in him the wild hybridity that coalesced in this region during the first century. He holds a sword and mace, and across his long cloak, the inscription in middle Brahmi, an ancient Indian script, now extinct, reads: \u201cThe Great King, King of Kings, Son of a God, Kanishka.\u201dIt was on coins issued by this museum-quality narcissist that we see some of the earliest images of the Buddha in human form. Was Kanishka aware of doing something that had never been done before? Was he merely mass-producing an image that had privately already entered human form as a cult object? Was the depiction of the Buddha as a human being the legacy of Greek influence in Bactria, or was there, as Coomaraswamy believes, a now lost origin story of the first Buddha in India, which was then adapted by Greek-trained craftsmen? These are the questions that swirl around this enigmatic moment in the history of art.The clearest answers lie in the fact that the Kushans would go on to establish two great centers of statuary. One was Gandhara, a region that stretches across modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan, and where the statues are of an ashen schist and bear the unmistakable mark of Hellenism, almost as if a bunch of Buddhas and bodhisattvas had showed up at a toga party. The other school \u2014 one I like more, for being less derivative \u2014 was Mathura, where craftsmen worked with a white-speckled russet stone. These Buddhas, unlike those of Gandhara, are of fuller body, with soft Indian bellies. They look less vain and haughty than the Gandhara Buddhas, and their faces possess a deep sympathy \u2014 that hint of a smile, as sorrowful and knowing an emotion as has ever been expressed in stone.From these two great workshops some of the earliest Buddhas burst forth into the world. \u201cThis new physical representation,\u201d writes Benjamin, \u201chelped the ideology of Buddhism transform itself into a religion and spread along the trade routes as far south as Sri Lanka and as far east as Korea and Japan.\u201d It was an image that adjusted itself to the places it traveled to, from Cambodia and Korea to Indonesia and Nepal, but the underlying thought the image expressed spoke more of continuity than difference, just as the image of Christ on the cross is a unifying one, despite its varied iterations. In addition to the mass production of Buddha\u2019s self, historical Asian texts indicate that Kanishka\u2019s reign also saw the widespread construction of monasteries and stupas, the convening of a major Buddhist conference in Kashmir and the large-scale translation of Buddhist texts into Sanskrit, which served the newly reconstituted religion as a major lingua franca.ImageThe Great Buddha of Kotoku-in, a Buddhist temple in Kamakura, Japan.

In A.D. 166, the Han emperor Huandi honored the Buddha with a sacrifice and, \u201cduring the two centuries that followed the collapse of the Han,\u201d writes Benjamin, \u201cmuch of the population of northern China adopted Buddhism, and by the sixth century the ideology had spread widely throughout southern China as well.\u201d Just as Buddhism had been a reaction to the hierarchical nature of Brahmin orthodoxy in India, so too in China, Benjamin feels, the Chinese warlords, who had felt disparaged by Confucianism, were attracted to the \u201cegalitarian creed.\u201d Monks, such as Kumarajiva, who was from Central Asia and active in the fourth century A.D., played a key role in translating Buddhist texts into Chinese. This, in turn, excited the curiosity of men like Faxian and Xuanzang, who flocked to India. These monks \u2014 not unlike the great book hunters of the Renaissance, such as Poggio Bracciolini, who in the 15th century discovered Lucretius\u2019s \u201cDe Rerum Natura,\u201d the classical poem that played so key a role in the intellectual rebirth of Europe \u2014 were primarily in search of manuscripts, philosophical treatises and biographical information about the life and times of the Buddha. The traffic of monks and scholars between India and China lasted well until the 12th century, when Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, a Turkic chieftain, destroyed the great Buddhist university of Nalanda, in what is today the eastern Indian state of Bihar.AT SARNATH, STANDING at the base of the Dhamek stupa, a giant embroidered band of sculpture, geometric designs and verdure wrapped around its midriff, I was reminded of the power of the image of the Buddha. Sacred images in ancient India were not made primarily as objects of beauty but rather as the expression of a philosophical thought, which is why the same image was made again and again. The Swiss artist and scholar Alice Boner, who lived in Varanasi from the 1930s until just before her death in 1981, cautioned against treating these images as mere objects of \u201caesthetic enjoyment.\u201d They were visual aids, \u201cborn in meditation and inner realization.\u201d Their ultimate aim, as \u201cfocusing points for the spirit,\u201d was to lead us \u201cback to meditation and to the comprehension of that transcendent reality from which they were born. If they are beautiful,\u201d Boner adds, taking a swipe at modern aesthetic notions, such as art for art\u2019s sake, \u201cit is because they are true.\u201dImageOne of the two covers of T\u2019s May 17 Travel issue.

I, for one, could not look at the image of the Buddha without being reminded of this description of the Hindu god Shiva from the Sanskrit poet Kalidasa\u2019s fifth-century work \u201cThe Birth of Kumara\u201d:The fierce pupils motionlessand their brightness slightly lessened,his eyes, directed downward,were focused on his nose,the eyelashes stationary,the stilled eyes stilling the brow.By restraint of his internal currentshe was like a cloudwithout the vehemence of rain,like an expanse of waterwithout a ripple,like a lamp in a windless place,absolutely still.The story of depicting the Buddha is ultimately one of continuity and rupture. Above all, it is a tale of how newness enters the world. It is also the paradigmatic Silk Road story, for being an inadvertent and quiet assertion of the creative freedom implicit in the meeting of cultures. Nothing is more quintessentially Indian than the image of the Buddha seated in padmasana, but for that quintessence to be unlocked, for thought to enter stone, as it were, a catalyst was needed. That catalyst was the Kushans. Through them, Greece, Persia, India and China bore witness, like godmothers in a fairy tale, to this second birth of the Buddha. Here, too, it seems \u2014 in our most inviolable symbols and icons, so pure as to seem without origin \u2014 lurks the mongrel spirit of hybridity, full of surprise and audacity, a perpetual thorn in the side of our tribalisms.Aatish Taseer\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Twice-Born: Life and Death on the Ganges\u201d (2019), was recently released in paperback.

The broad Soviet-style avenues of Uzbekistan\u2019s capital were lined with chestnut and Oriental plane, their leaves turning russet in the crisp autumn air. This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country\u2019s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan\u2019s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads \u2014 banks, museums and ministries \u2014 \u201cBabylonian blocks,\u201d as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in \u201cJourney to Khiva\u201d in the early \u201990s: \u201cSince the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.\u201d And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life.Four great creeds \u2014 Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Islam and Communism \u2014 had come via the trans-Asian caravan routes, or the Silk Road, to the land encapsulated by what is modern Uzbekistan. Each had made the people of this doubly landlocked country \u2014 one of only two, the other being Liechtenstein \u2014 of 34 million part of a greater world, a cosmopolis, a comity of nations. This was a land whose culture had been created on the frontier of contact with China, India, Iran and Russia, each of which fertilized the culture of the steppe. Communism was the last ideology to come to Uzbekistan along these routes, and I could not help but admire the scale and ambition of its artifacts. There was the Tashkent metro, 22 miles long, with majestic stations \u2014 several hung with three-tiered chandeliers \u2014 including one tiled in futuristic blue faience, dedicated exclusively to space exploration. There were the vast apartment blocks, with cramped windows and lace curtains. Their facades were crawling with satellite dishes, and on their broad flanks, there were crumbling murals and mosaics, which had been made as if out of a desultory spirit of concession to the need for people to have ornamentation in their lives at all.ImageA map illustrating the cities that T\u2019s contributors journeyed to for the May 17 Travel Issue alongside some of the many routes of the ancient Silk Road.Credit...Map by Daniel WagnerFor me, as someone who grew up in Delhi, the names of this region\u2019s fabled caravan towns \u2014 Samarkand and Bukhara \u2014 were the most evocative of the Silk Road. Each estimated to be founded no later than the first century A.D., these cities were imbued with the terror and wonder of the Turkic conqueror Timur \u2014 known as Tamerlane in the West \u2014 who came like a fury over the mountains that lay between India and Uzbekistan and laid waste to my hometown in 1398, killing, by his own count, 100,000 and erecting his famous minaret of skulls. Some 120 years after Timur, his descendant Babur \u2014 a banished prince of the Timurid dynasty \u2014 came back over those same mountains to found the Mughal dynasty in northern India, which lasted until the 19th century and was responsible for such marvels as the Taj Mahal. Delhi and Tashkent were just a three-hour flight apart from each other, but the girdle of mountains \u2014 the Hindu Kush, literally \u201cHindu Killer\u201d in Persian \u2014 that separated this land from the Indian plain was a boundary between worlds. To arrive here was to find myself in the uncanniest of all valleys \u2014 a place where shared references related to food, language and architecture were swiftly replaced by what was alien and unexpected.My guide, Aziz, 32, appeared magically out of the gloom of a cold and smoky night, dressed, like the hero in a Bollywood film, in a black-and-white gingham shirt, a Panama hat and a scarf around his neck. Aziz was born in the twilight years of the Soviet Union and, as he later pointed out to me, was among the last generation to grow up reading Soviet textbooks. Hearing him address a Vietnamese woman in Russian or seeing him point out Kazakhs, Koreans, Ukrainians and Russians on Hazrati Imam \u2014 a square of mosques and madrassas at the heart of old Tashkent \u2014 I was easily reminded of what is easy to forget: Russia, no less than France or Britain or Spain, had been a colonial enterprise, and her children were myriad and many. But before I could take in my new surroundings that first morning, Aziz sprung a surprise on me. Ten months before, his longtime girlfriend, Madina, had left him and gone away to Dubai. He had suffered excruciating heartbreak, he told me. He couldn\u2019t sleep, he couldn\u2019t eat, he begged her to return. He then cast a sidelong glance at a shy young woman, sulky and watchful, with pink nails, who now also appeared out of the murk to join him. Madina was back. She had arrived unexpectedly the day before Aziz and I were to embark on a weeklong trip through Uzbekistan, covering a distance of over a thousand miles in close quarters. Moreover, Aziz informed me, she was coming with us. Had the hour not been 3 a.m., had I not been so shattered from the 20-hour odyssey from my home in New York City and had I not been totally at Aziz\u2019s mercy in this former Soviet town, I would never have agreed to be the third wheel on my own trip. But the odds were not in my favor. Aziz, I sensed, was restless enough to cancel if I did not comply. I rolled a cigarette, nodded my consent and from thereon I vanished into the set of a modern-day Uzbek romance \u2014 Aziz and Madina, a love story.ImageThe prayer hall of the late 18th-century Juma Mosque in Khiva. Its design \u2014 which features more than 200 elm or other wood columns, over two dozen of which date back to either the 10th or 16th century \u2014 differs from those of most open-air mosques of the region, creating a more secluded environment for worship.Credit...Richard MosseTHE TERM \u201cSILK ROAD,\u201d or Seidenstrasse, is thought to have been first popularized in 1877 by the German geographer Ferdinand Paul Wilhelm, Baron von Richthofen. It is misleading in many ways, not merely because much more than silk was conveyed along this 4,000-mile ancient route \u2014 there was also lapis, turquoise, gold and ivory \u2014 but because it was richer still in the traffic of abstractions, ideas and religions. It came about a century before Christ, as a result of the mercantile interests of two great empires \u2014 imperial Rome and imperial China \u2014 gradually aligning, even as they were too far apart to trade directly with one another. As a natural consequence, the places that lay between the two shouldered the responsibility (and accrued the profits) of bringing them into contact with each other. \u201cChinese merchants were never seen in Rome,\u201d writes the British historian Peter Hopkirk in 1980 in \u201cForeign Devils on the Silk Road,\u201d \u201cnor Roman traders in Ch\u2019ang-an,\u201d referring to present-day Xi\u2019an. It was in the time of the Han dynasty\u2019s Emperor Wudi (156-87 B.C.) that a great pioneering traveler named Zhang Qian, whom Hopkirk describes as \u201cthe father of the Silk Road,\u201d forged a path westward into modern-day Uzbekistan. Zhang went west in search of allies, in order to fight an enemy of nomadic stock \u2014 the Xiongnu \u2014 who some believe were the very same people who arrived a few centuries later at the gates of Rome (by then they would have been known as the Huns). In the Fergana Valley, which sprawls across eastern Uzbekistan, southern Kyrgyzstan and northern Tajikistan, Zhang found something better than an ally \u2014 he found Ferghana horses, an essential machine of war in his emperor\u2019s fight against the Huns.Meanwhile, imperial Rome, stretching its fingers east, had encountered a \u201crevolutionary new material.\u201d In 53 B.C., at Carrhae, seven Roman legions led by Marcus Licinius Crassus stared in disbelief as their habitual and, in this instance, victorious enemy, the Parthians, from modern-day Iran, \u201cunfurled great banners\u201d of a shimmering, gossamer-like material: Chinese silk. \u201cThe Romans, who had never seen anything like it before,\u201d Hopkirk tells us, \u201cturned and fled, leaving some twenty thousand dead behind.\u201d The Romans knew that while the Parthians were a martial people, they were too \u201cunsophisticated\u201d to have invented \u201cthis astonishing material, which was \u201cas light as a cloud\u201d and \u201ctranslucent as ice.\u201d By the first century A.D., Romans were dripping in silk, which they still believed grew on trees. \u201cSeneca, for one,\u201d writes Peter Frankopan in his 2015 history \u201cThe Silk Roads,\u201d about the Roman philosopher, \u201cwas horrified by the popularity of the thin flowing material, declaring that silk garments could barely be called clothing given they hid neither the curves nor the decency of the ladies of Rome.\u201d The foundations of marriage itself were being compromised, Frankopan adds, by this fabric that \u201cleft little to the imagination.\u201dImageThe turquoise-tiled exterior of Kutlug Oko Mausoleum of the Shah-i-Zinda (Living King) necropolis in Samarkand.

On my first day in Tashkent, I encountered an object that remade my idea of the history of the place. I had not, until then, thought of Tashkent as a great Islamic capital \u2014 not like Istanbul, Cairo or Baghdad, say \u2014 but in the small Muyi Mubarak Library at Hazrati Imam, at the heart of old Tashkent, surrounded by ribbed azure domes swimming up against a pale sky, I saw what had to be among the wonders of the Islamic world: the oldest Quran in existence (best estimates date it to the eighth century). There it was, its swollen pages of gazelle skin inscribed with the bold black letters of the Kufic script. It had been the private Quran of the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, and it was Timur \u2014 the \u201cscourge of God\u201d in Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play \u201cTamburlaine the Great\u201d \u2014 who, having laid siege to the civilized world in the 14th century, brought it from what is now Iraq to his capital at Samarkand. Its presence in Tashkent was a reminder that if one was to do justice to the history of Uzbekistan, one would have to make a mental separation between the modern state \u2014 an unremarkable Central Asian republic with an autocrat at its helm \u2014 and the many worlds this land had been part of. The state was new, the land was eons old. It had once comprised Sogdiana and parts of Transoxania; it had been a point of confluence between Iran and Turan, the line between Persianate and Turkic cultures; the famous regions of Khorasan and Khwarezm were all part of what the land had known. It had produced a roll call of polymaths, from the scholar and scientist Al-Biruni to Ibn Sina, known to the West as Avicenna (980-1037), one of the fathers of early medicine. The creator of the algorithm \u2014 al-Khwarizmi (circa 780-circa 850) \u2014 had been part of the same flowering of genius that had made this land one of the centers of thought and discovery, as had the philosopher Alpharabius, or al-Farabi (circa 878-circa 950). This was the kingdom of the astronomer-king Ulugh Beg, whose 15th-century work was being translated into English and Latin in the years following the Renaissance.This land of many natures \u2014 Turkic and Persian, upon which Russian had been grafted \u2014 expressed itself in Aziz, too. One moment he was talking of Lenin and Stalin and quoting Aleksandr Pushkin\u2019s 1833 novel in verse, \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the next he was discussing the history of Islam and recalling whole quatrains of the 11th-century Persian poet and astronomer Omar Khayyam\u2019s \u201cRubaiyat.\u201d This was the place where one needed to come to understand how distinct cultures graded into one another. It was not so much a melting pot as a hologram, and this felt true of religious values, too: This was an Islamic country where everyone drank vodka and where the Soviet government, in the Communist years, had closed some 26,000 mosques; there were just 80 open in 1989. But Islam had had its revenge, too. In a bookshop on the main square, Aziz pointed to a pamphlet that showed pictures of Lenin\u2019s statue being torn down as it warned against idolatry.Aziz himself had undergone something of a Damascene un-conversion. Madina remembered him as being very religious, praying five times a day and talking endlessly about the Quran. \u201cBut then,\u201d Aziz said, \u201cI turned on my logic.\u201d He was now positively scornful of religious people, arguing with them about contentious subjects such as why, if Islam was a religion of peace, had it gone everywhere \u201cby sword and fire.\u201dImageThe ocher plains outside Khiva are a reminder of the inhospitable and vast terrain of the Kyzylkum Desert, where the Ayaz Kala ruins of an ancient third- or second-century B.C. fortress still stand.Credit...Richard Mosse\u201cI am shocked,\u201d Madina said.\u201cIt\u2019s a new life, baby,\u201d Aziz answered jauntily. He was a Bukhara boy to his bones, raised in, and still devoted to, his birthplace. It was his passion for the history of his hometown that had connected him with other Silk Road cities in Central Asia, forming the nucleus of a self-education, here from other guides, there from books in Farsi, English and Russian. But regardless of where his travels took him, he always came back to Bukhara, and he could not fathom Madina\u2019s restlessness, her wish to get away.On our first full evening together in Tashkent, a still older and deeper aspect of the character of this land asserted itself as the sun sank \u2014 the nomadic life of the steppe. Chorsu Bazaar was in central Tashkent, a short drive away from Hazrati Imam. It was a vast carapace of turquoise and cyan, which sought to bring order to the chaos of one of the main institutions of Central Asian life: the market. Handsome Tajik boys with thick unibrows \u2014 a mark of beauty in the Persianate world \u2014 sold turmeric, cumin, red chile and star anise. There was horse meat and tongue, trotters and brain. We passed smooth, dark offerings of liver, reddish-black in the fluorescent light, and the round marbled heads of bovine cannons. There were whole alleys devoted to salads and cheeses, and sour-milk balls called qurut, which I was told quenched thirst on long journeys across the steppe. Outside, women with gold teeth in bright aprons and waistcoats sold norin, noodles with horse meat. One plump-fingered lady cut me off a bit of khasib, a sausage made of rice and intestine, basting in a thick viscous liquid like a wounded snake. Chorsu, literally meaning \u201cfour streams\u201d or \u201ccrossroads\u201d in Persian, was visceral in the most literal sense of the word, and I felt it was impossible to come into contact with food like this without also being given an intimation of the brutality and rigors of the steppe. To never settle was to never be softened by the idea of home. It was easy to see how the decision to stay and build community, with all its implications for civilization, versus the decision to forge on and to live the life of the frontier, was among the earliest and most important choices that men had had to make.ImageKalta Minar, a 19th-century minaret near the entrance of Ichan-Kala, or the old city of Khiva, commissioned by the ruler Muhammad Amin Khan.Credit...Richard MosseImageA wider exterior view of the mausoleum of Shah-i-Zinda.Credit...Richard MosseTHE NEXT MORNING, we crossed the Jaxartes \u2014 also known as the Syr Darya, one of two great Central Asian rivers \u2014 and sped on through pale sunshine, yellowing screens of poplar and mulberry and a pointillist field of cotton, a scorched brown crop bedaubed white, on our way to Samarkand. There were vineyards and orchards. Melon season was ending and the pomegranates were ripening; women sold the dark juice in plastic bottles on the side of the highway. There were Tolstoyan scenes of soldiers picking cotton. I had expected desert and steppe. Instead, I found a dark, fertile soil, as rich as Andalusia, where everything from apples to apricots grew. Babur, the first Mughal, had been homesick in India for the sweetness of the fruits of his native land. In the beginning sections of his early 16th-century memoirs, \u201cBaburnama,\u201d there are endless descriptions of the fruit markets of Central Asia. I now began to see why. Autumn here was truly, as John Keats wrote, a \u201cseason of mists and mellow fruitfulness.\u201dAziz and Madina were asleep in the back seat. Our driver, Doniyor, a man in his 50s, spoke only one word of English \u2014 \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 which he sometimes used as an exclamation, and other times as a question.Before the galloping Russian conquest of the 19th century \u2014 the Russian Empire for over four centuries expanded at a rate of roughly 20,000 square miles a year \u2014 the land of this country had been divided into two khanates: Kokand in the east and Khiva in the west. Sandwiched in the middle, and famous for cruelty, decay and isolation, was the emirate of Bukhara, which included Samarkand. By the end of the 19th century, the khans and emirs had been reduced to puppet rulers, pensioners of the czar in Moscow. While the Silk Road, which increasingly became less relevant by the first quarter of the 20th century, fed them with trinkets from an industrializing Europe \u2014 here a mechanical calendar, there a clock and a camera \u2014 a new creed was ascendant in Europe. In 1917, the Bolsheviks smashed the power of the czar. Two years later, the Communists, under the leadership of Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze, were at the doors of these vassal kingdoms, driving their khans and emirs into exile.ImageUnderneath the carapace of Chorsu Bazaar, the central market of Tashkent, locals shop for everything from pomegranates and persimmons to spices, bread, nuts and meat.Credit...Richard MosseIt is hard to exaggerate the violence of the social and economic upheaval that Soviet rule brought to this country. The Uzbeks witnessed massive collectivization and industrialization; religion was proscribed; in 1927, Hujum, which means \u201cassault\u201d in Uzbek, was enacted under Stalin. These were social reforms that saw women give up the veil, participate in veil-burning ceremonies and join the work force. This pious feudal society was frog-marched at gunpoint out of the early Middle Ages and into the 20th century.Driving into Samarkand, 191 miles southwest from Tashkent, observing giant Timurid pylons and ribbed turquoise domes rising out of the low sprawl, one felt as if the change this society had seen in the last century was inscribed in stone. Timur had breathed fire into the veins of the old Silk Road. He was born when the memory of the destruction that Genghis Khan had wrought was still fresh, and Timur, as if assimilating the fury of the great Mongol, had weaponized the ancient trade linkages. The map of his campaigns looks like an explosion out of Samarkand in every direction through the civilized world. He lashed out in the direction of Istanbul, taking the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I captive at the Battle of Ankara, south to Delhi, and died on the warpath east to China. It was not quite violence for violence\u2019s sake. \u201cThere was another equally, if not more, compelling reason to pick a fight,\u201d writes Justin Marozzi in \u201cTamerlane,\u201d his humanizing 2004 history of the tyrant. \u201cKhorezm straddled the caravan routes linking China to the Mediterranean, and therefore enjoyed great prosperity.\u201d Timur turned the Silk Road into his personal exchequer, using its revenues, as well as plunder and taxes levied on conquered people, to fund campaign after terrifying campaign.\u201cIf you doubt our power,\u201d Aziz said as we stood at the foot of Timur\u2019s statue in Samarkand, \u201clook upon our buildings.\u201d It was the Timurid creed, and the evidence of its gigantomania was everywhere in this city. \u201cIn the one field in which he took a real interest,\u201d writes S. Frederick Starr in 2013, in \u201cLost Enlightenment,\u201d of Timur, \u201cand on which he showered money \u2014 architecture \u2014 his enthusiasm stemmed precisely from its ability to dramatize a very specific idea: that of his own power and greatness.\u201d The statue of this conqueror sat in the middle of a roundabout, surrounded by broad avenues, lined with the pale mottled trunks of Oriental planes. The man whose name was still uttered with horror and disgust in India gazed loftily upon his own mausoleum, Gur-e-Amir, a building that had been intended as a tomb for Timur\u2019s beloved grandson but became the Timurid crypt after the conqueror\u2019s death on the warpath to China in 1405. The entrancing blue of its exterior caught the afternoon sun. There were honeycombed stalactites, or muqarnas, in its portal. The squarish Kufic script, its hard angles a counterpoint to the floral excesses of the rest of the design, snaked its way up in bright blue over the two minarets. There was nothing in the world that spoke more definitely of Central Asia \u2014 a dream of moisture in an arid land \u2014 than that tiled blue. I had seen shreds of it in India, but now I felt as if I had come to its source. Timur did not invent the turquoise tile \u2014 it came, like all great things Islamic, from Persia \u2014 but he made it sing. His artisans cut and carved it; they dressed slim pillars in it and giant domes; they shoved it in squinches and let it unfurl over the spandrels of arches. As Aziz said, \u201cTimur wanted to build in a color that would challenge the sky with its own beauty.\u201dImageSilk awnings shelter a bazaar outside the madrassa of Muhammad Amin Khan in Khiva.Credit...Richard MosseIt was odd to think of the sanguinary conqueror at rest under a slab of black jade. His martial spirit had stalked the ages so much so that it was said that if Timur\u2019s sleep was ever disturbed, the dogs of war would be loosed upon the earth again. The godless Soviets paid no heed to these superstitions and had him dug up in June 1941. No sooner was he awake, his skeleton being prodded and poked in Moscow, than Stalin learned that Nazi Germany had invaded the U.S.S.R.IN SAMARKAND, I felt melancholy, which followed me west to Bukhara and deepened in Khiva. It had a specific cause: At Samarkand\u2019s Registan square, I learned of the extent to which the city\u2019s buildings, first under the Soviets and later under the Uzbeks, had been unsparingly restored. It was so comprehensive that it utterly obliterated the action of time. Philip Glazebrook, in the 1990s, on seeing something similar in Khiva, asked himself: \u201cBut what has renovation, matched colors, taste and tidiness, to do with an Asiatic city? The deadly aim of those weapons has killed Khiva stone dead.\u201dThey were words that could not be unread. I had researched old 1960s photographs of tented shops, horse-drawn carriages and men in white turbans on the main enclosure of the Registan. The tile work crumbled from the Brobdingnagian pylons, but the square was alive. It had all since been swept away. The assiduous spirit of restoration contained an invisible agent, sanitizing and astringent, that hollowed \u201cthe East\u201d out of Samarkand\u2019s buildings, turning them into mere facades. I began to feel the Soviets had performed an operation in which the culture of the land had been dismembered from its every physical expression.ImageGlazed and gilded tile work adorns the interior of this mausoleum, built in 1405 and thought to memorialize one of Timur\u2019s wives, Tuman Agha, at the Shah-i-Zinda necropolis in Samarkand.Credit...Richard MosseImageAt 184 feet, the Islam Khoja Minaret, completed in 1910, is the tallest structure in Khiva\u2019s Ichan-Kala, a UNESCO World Heritage site.Credit...Richard MosseGlimmers of an older life were still visible in Samarkand. Not in the heavily restored buildings but in more surprising places. One night, as we \u2014 Aziz, Madina, Doniyor and I \u2014 were coming home from dinner, we encountered a wedding procession for two couples. The silence of a deserted street in Samarkand was interrupted by drumbeats and cars honking in tune. Young men in dark suits danced in front, carrying a metal pole with a heart-shaped standard that had been wrapped in sackcloth, doused in kerosene and set alight. One of the grooms was in a long black-and-gold tunic, the other in white picked out in cerise. The groomsmen would lower the heart of fire and dance around it \u2014 half, it seemed, in reverence, half in rapture \u2014 while all the time singing in praise of the newlyweds: \u201cYur, yur, yure.\u201d That word \u2014 yaar in Urdu \u2014 meant \u201clover,\u201d \u201cfriend\u201d and, ultimately, \u201cGod,\u201d too. It indicated a spiritual union, and these young men, with their ancestral veneration of fire, felt part of an extremely old ritual \u2014 an atavism in the true sense of forefather, with its origins in the Zoroastrian worship of fire.This land of many faiths produced an unstable system of values. Aziz and Madina seemed so much a modern couple, living together, traveling together, sleeping unmarried in the same hotel room. But I realized that under the veneer of modernity, more conservative values prevailed. At the Samarkand Restaurant, with its baroque interiors and loud music, now Turkish and Uzbek, now Persian, Afghan and Russian, Aziz offered Madina wine. Her natural sulkiness fell away and she began to tap her manicured fingers to the tune of Glukoza\u2019s \u201cTantsui, Rossiya!\u201d: \u201cDance, Russia! And cry, Europe / For I have the most beautiful ass in the world.\u201d When she got up to dance, Aziz grew confidential. \u201cBukhara society is very conservative,\u201d he said. As he spoke to me about the way his relationship with Madina would be judged by his society, I realized that these cities \u2014 Samarkand and Bukhara, in particular \u2014 had been the equivalent of what places like Singapore and Dubai are today. They had been deeply cosmopolitan, places whose values, aesthetics and religious beliefs were fluid, defined by the different people who passed through. Earlier, when examining a Central Asian mosque with its stone terrace, wooden pillars and painted canopy, I asked Aziz if the mosque was quintessentially Central Asian. He seemed puzzled by my question. \u201cThree thousand years ago,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were invaded by the Persians, so we have something from Persia; 1,500 years ago, we were invaded by the Arabs, so we have something from the Arabs; 1,000 years ago, we were invaded by the Mongols, so we have something from them. There is no such thing as \u2018our style.\u2019\u201d Without a trace of the need for historical purity that had spread through so much of the world and was feeding a new populism in places like India and Turkey, Aziz said, \u201cThese are cities that would not have existed were it not for the Silk Road.\u201dDRIVING TO BUKHARA, we went through bare sunlit hills, their deep furrows full of shadow. Below was the thin slip of a silver stream, which created islands of dark soil, supporting orchards, vineyards and reddening mulberries, whose leaves are the food of the silkworm. \u201cWe have an expression,\u201d Aziz said. \u201cOnly mountains can be more beautiful than mountains.\u201d For seven centuries, the secret of how silk was made remained firmly in China. Hopkirk writes that it was supposedly Nestorian monks who smuggled silkworm eggs out of China in their staffs. Aziz now told a story of a Chinese princess who married an Uzbek chieftain and carried the worms out, concealing them in her elaborate hairdo.ImageGlazed geometric tiles adorn an early 19th-century iwan in the kurinish khona, or reception courtyard, of the Kunya Ark citadel in Khiva, where the khan entertained public audiences.Credit...Richard MosseThe hills grew steeper and were covered in a burnt-blond grass. We were in what I can only imagine were the foothills of the Pamirs, the mountain range beyond which lay Persian-speaking Tajikistan. The winding road was lined with signs that said \u201cTandir\u201d \u2014 clay ovens known as tandoor in India \u2014 and which, like comca (pronounced \u201csomsa\u201d), cousin of the Indian samosa, were only more proof of the many fruits of the Silk Road. At a clearing in the mountains, a market had sprung up. Women in black visors, with brightly colored scarves, velveteen jackets and baggy trousers, had brought the riches of the hills to be sold. They had sacks of licorice and dried yellow immortal flowers \u2014 Helichrysum arenarium \u2014 which aided digestion. There were sunflower seeds, rhubarb and ginseng \u2014 beige, husky and loofah-like. There were dried figs and red-berried dog rose. Looking out over those crevassed hills, with outcroppings of dark rock showing through the yellow grass, I felt that this spontaneous spirit of mercantilism was at the heart of the Silk Road. The opening up of sea routes in the 15th century, both between Europe and Asia, as well as Europe and the Americas, had starved this region of the magic ingredient that had been its making: its centrality. For the first time in 15 centuries, Central Asia was no longer on the way to everywhere.We reached Bukhara at night. Of all the cities I had been to, and was going to, only Bukhara had the right to call itself Bukhara Sharif \u2014 \u201cBukhara, the noble.\u201d This was the emirate where the 19th-century explorer Alexander Burnes dismounted his horse and changed his clothes before entering its holy precincts that owed their sanctity to the hundreds of mosques, madrassas and mausoleums they contained, for \u201cthese are the emblems of distinction in the holy city of Bokhara [sic] between an infidel and a true believer,\u201d he wrote in 1835. Bukhara, which had given Islam some of its foremost thinkers \u2014 the ninth century\u2019s al-Bukhari, a compiler of Muhammad\u2019s sayings and acts, or Hadith, and the 14th century\u2019s Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, the founder of the Sufi order Naqshbandi \u2014 had, as the Silk Road dried up around it, leaving it stranded, become a byword in the 19th century for insularity and zealotry.We drove through modern streets, lined with emporiums and hotels. The buildings seemed to creep out of one malaise \u2014 blockish and socialist \u2014 into another, the faux modernity of pasting blue-and-brown glass squares onto the facades of crumbling buildings. This was Aziz, Madina and Doniyor\u2019s hometown. I was dropped on the edge of a depopulated old city of a few thousand and allowed to wander alone through the desolate streets. The town of hundreds of madrassas and caravansaries, and 100 or so mosques, had been subjected to the only fate worse than Genghis Khan\u2019s, that fifth horseman of the apocalypse: tourism. There were hardly any people, save visitors who came in droves to see the storied Silk Road town for themselves. The buildings were mostly hotels, restaurants or boutiques. I stood at the foot of the 12th-century Kalyan minaret, which even the Great Mongol had spared from destruction, watching red-colored light play on its varied sand-colored surface. I had grown up in India and known many forms of cultural decay, ruin and vandalism in my life, but I had never known this willful, state-engineered cleaving of a living culture from its physical embodiment, and the establishment of what Glazebrook calls \u201cthe museum-city.\u201d Bukhara had decayed organically until the 1960s and \u201970s, when its people were put in modern apartment blocks by the Soviets, who turned the city\u2019s buildings into a heavily restored Potemkin village for tourists to visit.ImageThe imposing ruins of the medieval walled city known as Dzhanpik-Kala, thought to have been built in the ninth and 10th centuries and destroyed by Timur in the late 14th century, are situated near the banks of the Amu Darya. In places, the jagged remains of the citadel\u2019s crenellated walls stand up to 40 feet high.Credit...Richard MosseON MY LAST full day in Uzbekistan, racing through the red desert on the road to Khiva, some 280 miles northwest, I was given a glimpse of those vast blank spaces that lay between the caravan towns of the Silk Road; without them, it was impossible to understand these towns\u2019 importance. The Kyzylkum (Red Sand) Desert floated above a sea of natural gas. The earth was covered in a faded green-and-pink shrub called saxaul. An immense pale blue Texas-size sky rose above us. The Oxus River, or Amu Darya, lay in a band of silver to our left, forming the border with the hermit kingdom of Turkmenistan, where the dictator Saparmurat Niyazov (also called Turkmenbashi) renamed the days of the week in honor of himself and his family members. My spirits rose at the sight of this desolation, for it was only with this nullity in mind that one could imagine what it was to see the minarets of Khiva, their blue tiles canceling out the despair of the desert, as light from a lighthouse cancels out the darkness of the sea.Bukhara lay behind me, distilled into a memory of one sublime building, a Samanid mausoleum, which seemed to tie together all the different strands of Silk Road religion and history. It had been built by the Samanid dynasty around the 10th century at the pinnacle of this region\u2019s glory \u2014 when men like Avicenna and Al-Biruni walked the earth \u2014 and it was a miracle, having been buried in sand, that it survived the 13th-century onslaught of Genghis Khan. An understated cube, with four sleeping pillars, it stood in isolation in northwestern Bukhara. After the renovated excesses of blue and cyan, and the overworked turquoise tile, the austerity of the Samanid tomb, utterly innocent of the use of color, was as refreshing as an unpainted beam of wood. What it did have, worked over every inch, from entablature to pediment to inset pillar, were raptures of baked brick, creating a varied and intricate surface laden with symbolism.\u201cLet\u2019s start to read it,\u201d Aziz said. \u201cIt reads like a book.\u201d Bukhara was once home to a Buddhist community, part of that two-way traffic of monks and scholars, which would cease after the coming of Islam in the eighth and ninth centuries \u2014 its name was drawn from the Sanskrit word for monastery, vihara. Aziz pointed at the circles, or chakras, that ran along its pediment. The Uzbek scholar Shamsiddin Kamoliddin saw direct Buddhist references in the mandalas in the two spandrels of the central doorway. I saw them, too. Aziz saw crosses, and fleurs-de-lis, as well as the inverted Zoroastrian triangles indicating good thoughts, good words, good deeds. This was among the oldest Islamic tombs in Central Asia, and it was difficult to think of a more indispensable building. It stood like proof of the many natures of this land of confluence.ImageOne of the two covers of T\u2019s May 17 Travel issue.

Here, Zhangye Danxia National Geopark in Gansu, China.Credit...Zhang XiaoIn my last hours in Uzbekistan, before catching a flight back to New York, I walked along the ramparts of Khiva\u2019s Ichan-Kala, or walled inner town, with Madina. The light faded from the clear desert sky, and though the green domes and blue minarets of Khiva were beautiful, I was beginning to tire of these museum cities. I was glad I had managed to see Aziz\u2019s apartment in Bukhara. It was part of a mikrorayon, or residential complex, set among acres upon acres of identical communist buildings, where dismal yellow lights came on in cramped windows and little bits of corrugated board held together the gray facades. This was how the great majority of the population of these romantic towns actually lived. No cupolas and courts for them, or shadows in the sand. The apartment, with its furry chocolate-colored rug and its unwashed dishes and a small window in the kitchen, was oppressive. I could see why Madina had done a runner nearly a year before. Moreover, when Aziz confided to me that he was prone to jealous rages, I thought she should run again.\u201cWhat is the weather like in London?\u201d she asked.\u201cRainy,\u201d I replied, and asked her what she had done in Dubai for 10 months.\u201cI work as a hostess in an Italian restaurant,\u201d she said. \u201cThey specialize in truffles.\u201dTruffles in Dubai, I thought. Here was a fruit of the Silk Road, if ever there was one!It was the ingenuity and industry of men who brought rare and precious things to far-flung places that had blazed a network of roads across the spine of Asia. That energy was alive and well. All that had happened was that its course, like the shape-shifting Oxus, had changed. The spirit of the Silk Road, I could now see, was all movement, mercantile and unsentimental. It had no time to pay homage to the relics of what had merely been the easy exchange of goods and ideas. The unforgiving logic of trade had reduced the fabled cities of the old Silk Road \u2014 Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva \u2014 to backwaters. Their outstanding monuments, shells to the glory of past relevance, remained, as did the romance of their names, but the caravans had long since moved on.Aatish Taseer\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Twice-Born: Life and Death on the Ganges\u201d (2019), was recently released in paperback.
